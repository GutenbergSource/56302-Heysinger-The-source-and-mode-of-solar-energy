<HTML><BODY>A strong objection against Darwin's theory of evolution was the huge time-span, expressed in hundreds of millions of years, required for the process; while no source of energy was known that could maintain the energy output of the sun for such huge periods. This book addresses this issue, using the scientific knowledge of its day. The book, however, contains religious views, and ends with a religious conclusion, which shouldn't surprise us, as the author also has written books with titles as <i>Spirit & matter before the bar of modern science</i>. Curiously, he was also granted US patent 285034 A as the inventor of <i>Method of and Appliance for Disposing of Dead Bodies.</i>

<p>The riddle as to the source of energy of the sun was resolved in 1920, when Arthur Eddington, combining the Einstein's formula <i>E = Mc<sup>2</sup></i> (basically, a tiny bit of matter can be converted to a tremendous amount of energy, the <i>c</i> in the formula is the speed of light) with F.W. Aston's observation that 4 hydrogen nuclei weigh less than one helium nucleus, suggested that nuclear fusion, in which hydrogen combines to form helium, and emitting considerable energy in the process, was the sun's source of energy, and that it could easily account for a sun shining, as it does today, for many billions of years.
