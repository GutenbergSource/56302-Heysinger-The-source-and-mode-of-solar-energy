<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This work is not presented to the reader as a treatise
on astronomy, although the different phenomena pertaining to that
splendid science are reviewed with some detail, and the established
facts bearing upon the subjects discussed are briefly cited in the very
words of the great writers upon whose authority they rest. A
considerable experience in chemistry, electricity, and the other allied
physical sciences long since convinced the author of this work that
some simple and uniform principle must control the production of the
physical phenomena of astronomy,&mdash;some general law capable of
being extended in its application to the widest, as well as applied to
the narrowest, limits of that science. Knowing the absolute certainty
of a magnetic and electrical connection between the sun and the earth,
as evidenced by the reflected energy of sun-spots, auroras, etc., and
that no known cause except electricity could account for some, at
least, of the cometic phenomena, it seemed that any comprehensive law
must at all events include this mode of energy as an effective cause,
and that if the law be uniform in its application, it must equally
exclude all others which may be either antagonistic or not necessary. A
careful investigation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8"
name="pb8">8</a>]</span>was therefore made of those less generally
known principles concerned in the generation and transformations of
electrical energy, in order to determine the sufficiency or
insufficiency of this agency in the grander operations of nature (for,
of course, mere currents of electricity could play no part in these
phenomena), with the result that every line of research led
irresistibly to the conclusions presented in this work. These
investigations, specifically directed, at first, to the source and mode
of the solar energy of our own system alone, were found to be equally
applicable to others, and were successively extended to the whole
sidereal, nebular, and cometic field, and finally to space itself, for
all the phenomena of which it seemed to furnish an adequate and
harmonious interpretation. The fact, when once demonstrated, that the
true source of <i>solar</i> energy is not to be found in the sun
itself, but in the potential energy of space, served as a guiding
principle, and, by its continuously extended application, was found to
cover perfectly the source and mode of all solar energy. Every step of
the investigation has been based on the established facts of science
and the observations of eminent astronomers as laid down by the best
authorities; and the quotations herein made from their works are full
and fair, and are properly credited in every case, and taken from books
easily accessible to the general reader. It is hoped that further
attention may be directed to this field of research by far more capable
investigators than the author of this work, so that systematic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>astronomy may no longer bear the reproach that it is
largely an empirical science, but that it may henceforth be based upon
rational and comprehensive principles, capable of universal extension
and of general scientific application.</p>
<p>The authorities cited in this work include many illustrious names:
Proctor, Tyndall, Helmholtz, Langley, Huggins, Newcomb, Young,
Flammarion, Balfour Stewart, R. Kalley Miller, Herschel, Nichol, Lord
Rosse, Urbanitsky, Crookes, Fraunhofer, Ball, and many others, all of
whom are known throughout the world as among the master minds of
science. From them we have drawn the rich stores of knowledge of the
phenomena with which this work deals, and which we have so fully and
freely cited, as the basis of the splendid superstructure which
astronomy to-day reveals. No one will venture to controvert the
statements of fact made by these eminent men, and, where conflict of
opinion has arisen among them, we have quoted all parties, so that the
reader can form his own conclusion, in each case, for himself. So
diverse, apparently, are the phenomena reviewed that they present the
aspect of a great picture-gallery, in which the paintings totally
differ from each other in subject, in treatment, and in origin, their
only common qualities being those of grandeur and fidelity to truth and
to the principles of art. But they are not merely paintings, they are
the moving panorama of creation, and, diverse as they may appear, they
will be found to show the same &ldquo;handling,&rdquo; which reveals
the same universal artist; they have, in truth, a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>common
mode of development and a common principle of construction, obscure as
these may seem to be.</p>
<p>For thousands of years &ldquo;Natural History,&rdquo; so called, was
studied and taught; zo&ouml;logy was a well-known science far back in
old historic times. But it was left for modern biological research to
turn from these fixed and fully-developed forms of life, and go back to
trace their primal development through what is now the science of
embryology, and thus we have learned that nature traverses the same
paths in forming a man as in producing a frog or a bird. The process is
carried further along in one case than in another, but the lines of
development are almost identical; and the tracing out of these common
lines and their subsequent divergencies has shed a flood of new light
upon these dark and hitherto unknown places, so that we are now fairly
on the true highway of physical life at last. When adult forms were
alone compared, animal with animal, no common ground of origin or
development could be discerned; nature was believed to work by
&ldquo;special creations,&rdquo; and vast cataclysms were devised to
utterly destroy the organic life of one terrestrial epoch after
another, leaving a few hardy accidental survivors, or
&ldquo;types,&rdquo; perchance, to trace back their lines of descent
beyond such periods of cyclical destruction. All this is now changed,
and these views, so recently held and taught, have been abandoned
forever, and continuously operative natural processes of development,
modified by environment and heredity, have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>taken
their place, and biology now has a future as well as a past. And so it
must be with the less complex, but far more extended, creations and
transformations in the vast fields of astronomical science with which
this book is concerned. Hitherto we have here, too, dealt with
&ldquo;special creations&rdquo; and cataclysms; henceforth we must
follow the uniform and eternal laws of progressive development.</p>
<p>Among the multitude of hitherto unsolved problems of astronomy we
may enumerate the following: Why sun-spots travel faster around the sun
when near his equator than when more distant from it. The physical
causes of sun-spots, facul&aelig;, and solar prominences. Why the
number and size of sun-spots seem to affect terrestrial magnetism. The
rational interpretation of the eleven-year and the long sun-spot
cycles. The origin of the aurora borealis. The causes of the
periodicity of regularly variable stars. How to explain, in accordance
with the nebular hypothesis, why Algol and its companion, which are not
greatly different in mass and volume, and both obviously gaseous,
should so differ in character, one being a bright sun and the other a
dark planet. Whether there are great, compact, but dark bodies,
comparable to suns and planets in magnitude, and unconnected with any
solar system, floating about in space. Why double and multiple stars
are so frequently of contrasted or complementary colors. Why regularly
variable stars are longer in decline than in growth of brilliancy,
since such decline is no criterion of loss of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>heat,
but rather the reverse. Why the sun and fixed stars have atmospheres
largely composed of free hydrogen, and the planets have atmospheres of
free oxygen and nitrogen. Why a small and sometimes even scarcely
visible star occasionally is seen to suddenly blaze up, in a few hours,
to hundreds of times its normal brilliancy, and then far more gradually
fade, through months and years, back to its former state, in which
thenceforth it continues to maintain its original lustre. Why comets,
when they have tails, always project these appendages radially from the
direction of the sun. How to account for the presence of cyanogen, and
how for the absence of oxygen and the constant presence of hydrocarbon
vapors around the nuclei of comets. Why some comets split up into
separate comets and others sometimes show multiple tails. Why comets,
when they pass around and behind the sun, in some cases reappear shorn
of their splendor and in other cases with their splendor greatly
enhanced. Whence comets are derived, where is their permanent
abiding-place, and how did they originally reach those distant regions
which they occupy before entering our system, if merely the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> left behind from contraction of the mass of plasma
out of which our solar system is supposed to have been formed. Why so
many of the irresolvable nebul&aelig; present the appearance of
divergent spirals of many different forms. How to account for the
annular nebul&aelig; with hollow centers and for those
partially-completed planetary nebul&aelig;, so called, which afterwards
appear to retrograde <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13"
name="pb13">13</a>]</span>into diffused gaseous nebul&aelig; again or
gradually disappear. What is the ultimate constitution of interstellar
space? Have the fixed stars planetary systems like our own, or not?
Must they have such, or merely may they have? What principle of
conservation of energy is it possible to apply to the vast quantities
of light and heat which constantly disappear in the interstellar realms
of space? How to account for this enormous emission of solar energy
during the long period of time requisite for the development of the
earth during its past geological ages. How to explain why the moon
always presents the same face to the earth. Why, if the law of gravity
prevails there, there are no visible traces of atmosphere or moisture
in the moon. What is the basic principle on which depends the ratio of
mean planetary distances, 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, etc., <i>always plus 4</i>?
What is the origin of the planetary satellites and the cause of their
irregular distribution, and what the origin of Saturn&rsquo;s rings?
How was the belt of asteroids formed between Mars and Jupiter? Why is
the orbit of Neptune relatively compressed against that of Uranus? Why
is the mass of Neptune out of its proper proportion compared with those
of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in a diminishing series? What
is the rational interpretation and what the origin of the sun&rsquo;s
corona and the cause of the coronal streamers?</p>
<p>There are many other problems equally difficult which are
encountered in the study of this noble science, but the above are
surely sufficiently striking. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>Any complete interpretation of these
various phenomena, even singly, would seem to be an important step in
advance; then how much more so if the explanation of one and all of
these is to be found in a single, all-embracing cause, a few simple and
uniformly operative principles, as unquestionably operative here as in
the other fields of science to which they pertain, and which, once
thoroughly comprehended and rigidly applied, will be found to elucidate
all the multifarious phenomena of sidereal space so clearly and
precisely that any intelligent observer and reasoner can determine each
question finally for himself, and solve not only these, but all the
other astronomical problems and paradoxes which have from time to time
arisen? It is not to be understood that this sublime science and these
illimitable realms are to be laid off with the metes and bounds of a
farmer&rsquo;s meadow, for all the lines of the different sciences are
linked together at a thousand points, but that the operative principles
which nature constantly employs once firmly grasped, the intricacy of
each series of phenomena encountered will become gradually lessened,
link by link, as observations and deductions are more closely and
rationally made along these well-established lines of research, instead
of here and there, empirically, and at hap-hazard, as has been the only
method hitherto possible to pursue. When the relatively few fixed
principles which control the operations of nature in the field of
astronomy are thoroughly comprehended, for on this vast panorama she
lays her colors with a heavy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href=
"#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>brush, we can study her phenomena and
interpret her processes even more readily than the kindred sciences
have enabled us to do in the adjacent fields of biology, wherein the
splendid achievements of less than a quarter of a century past have not
only aroused the interest and enthusiasm of the world, but already
point the way to still grander triumphs yet to come. <span class=

OF<br>
SOLAR ENERGY.</h2>
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h2 class="main">STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM OF SOLAR ENERGY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In endeavoring to present a new and rational
interpretation of the source and mode of solar energy, based upon the
established principles of recent science, it becomes necessary to
briefly cite the facts bearing upon the problem to be solved and the
authorities for their support, as well as to describe concisely the
different hypotheses at present in vogue, and to point out the
well-established insufficiency of these theories, one and all, to
account for or explain the difficulties encountered, and which so far
have remained as an unsolved enigma. And this problem of solar energy
is the grandest and most important question of all physics, for upon
the light and heat of the sun depend all physical life and its
consequences, animal and vegetable, past, present, and future. If
within finite time, and relatively, compared with the enormous vistas
of the past, a very brief time, this source of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>energy
is to cease, and our whole system be involved in darkness and death,
such darkness and death must be eternal; for the dead sun in his final
stage of condensation will be as fixed and unchangeable as the
operation of eternal laws can make it, and henceforth there can be no
revival or reversals, no turning back of the hand upon the dial, while
the laws of nature continue; and outside the uniform operation of the
laws of nature there is no source, or mode, or continuance of solar
energy conceivable. It is true that when our system shall have ran down
to its culmination in death, other present systems may continue for a
time to exist and new ones spring into being; but these, too, must
inevitably follow the same course, and likewise end in eternal
darkness, until finally the great experiment of creation shall have
ended in eternal failure. The changes we see in progress around us,
however, are not of this nature. The individual dies, but the forces
which gave life and strength to the race persist, and others will take
his place, and the same forces will continue to operate with constant
renewals, since we draw our light and heat and life from without; but
in the death of suns and their attendant planets there is no analogous
process, for such suns are constantly expending their enormous energies
in the support of life external to themselves, and only the smallest
part of this energy, even, can ever be utilized by themselves or by
other suns or planets under any mode of interpretation now in vogue,
the boundless realms of so-called inert and empty space receiving the
same proportionate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19"
name="pb19">19</a>]</span>quota of light and heat as the almost
microscopic points in the sky which constitute the suns and systems we
see, and practically all, or nearly all, of this enormous energy is an
absolute dead waste; so that whether receiving new supplies from a
constant rain of adjacent meteor streams, or from the gradual
contraction of the solar volume, the vast realms of space are the
useless recipients of what can never return to the sun again, and, of
course, in such case the inevitable end can be predicted; for
contraction of volume, with a given mass, must have an effective limit,
and meteoric aggregation must also find an effective limit, if the
planets are not to be thrown out of place as they continue to revolve
around the sun.</p>
<p>All accepted theories begin with a primordial impulse, the energies
of which are of necessity constantly frittered away and wasted, until
finally all light and heat and life must cease to exist, and that at a
stage in which no further impulse can ever be given, since the whole
universe will have passed through every possible stage of degradation
down to the final one of universal and eternal death. And yet this is
the best that science has to suggest; the only comfort offered us is
that it will not happen in our time, and so, &ldquo;after us the
deluge.&rdquo; The nebular hypothesis, so called, of Laplace, has
required much modification, in the light of more recent science, but
the essential principles of this theory are still generally accepted,
for they fairly well account for the primal connection of the sun and
planets, and the position of the central <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>sun within, with the
orbital and rotational planetary movements, as no other theory has yet
done. By this theory the limits of our solar system were once occupied
by an attenuated gaseous nebula containing within itself all the matter
which now forms our solar system. This great nebular mass, primordially
assumed, was given by gravity a slow but gradually increasing rotation
upon its center; the force of gravity acted more strongly upon this
rotating body as it contracted, so that rings of nebulous matter were
successively thrown off, which coalesced into single masses and these
finally into planets. These planetary globes themselves, as they
coalesced and contracted, left behind or threw off rings of their outer
matter, which, in turn, became moons, and finally our solar system with
its central sun was evolved as we now see it; development continued,
the planets cooled and condensed, life appeared when the conditions
became suitable, and the original progressive condensation of the
central mass&mdash;the sun&mdash;still continuing, the evolution of
light and heat continues, and will continue in a correlative degree. As
our moon has passed, apparently, beyond the stage of life, and is cold,
airless, waterless, and dead, so will the earth pass; and the larger
planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, which have not yet reached the
life stage of condensation, are still hot, but they, too, will pass
through the present stage of the earth, then through that in which the
moon now is; and the central sun, still glowing, but more and more
dimly, will itself pass through the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21"
href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>stages in which Jupiter and
Saturn now are, then through that of our present earth, and finally
into that of the moon, long before which time the emission of all light
and heat will have ceased from the sun to its encircling planets, and
finally the sun itself will sink into eternal frigidity, and all its
store of light and heat will have been dissipated into boundless space,
and the possibility of anything resembling what we know as life will
have been forever extinguished. In considering the question of the
sun&rsquo;s energy, the author of the article &ldquo;Sun,&rdquo; in
Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia, says, &ldquo;How to account for the
supply of the prodigious amount of heat constantly radiated from the
solar surface has offered a boundless field of hypothesis. One
conjecture is that the sun is now giving off the heat imparted to it at
its creation, and that it is gradually cooling down (1). Another
ascribed it to combustion (2), and a third to currents of electricity
(3). Newton and Buffon conjectured that comets might be the aliment of
the sun (4); and of late years a somewhat similar theory (first
broached by Mr. Waterston in 1853) has been in vogue,&mdash;viz., that
a stream of meteoric matter constantly pouring into the sun from the
regions of space supplies its heat, by the conversion into it of the
arrested motion (5). As the sun may, indeed, derive a small amount of
heat from this cause, it deserves more attention than previous
conjectures. But conjecture and hypothesis may be said to have given
place to views which claim a higher title, as it is now becoming
generally recognized, in accordance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>with modern physical theories of
heat, that in the gravitation of the sun&rsquo;s mass toward its
center, and in its consequent condensation, sufficient heat must be
evolved to supply the present radiation, enormous as this undoubtedly
is. It appears to be susceptible of full demonstration that a
contraction of the sun&rsquo;s volume of a given definite amount, which
is yet so slight as to be invisible to the most powerful telescope, is
competent to furnish a heat-supply equal to all that can have been
emitted during historical periods. According to this theory, then
(which is largely due to the development by Helmholtz of Mayer&rsquo;s
great generalization), the sun&rsquo;s mass remains unaltered, and its
temperature nearly constant, while its size is slowly diminishing as it
contracts; so slowly, however, that the supply may be reckoned on
through periods almost infinite as measured by the known past of our
race, and which are in any case to be counted by millions of years
(6).&rdquo; To these must be added the hypothesis of Dr. Siemens, fully
described in Professor Proctor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mysteries of Time and
Space.&rdquo; This ingenious theory, in brief, is that the rotation of
the sun on its axis causes a suction in the manner of a fan, at the
poles, and a tangential projection, at the equator, of a disk-like
stream of gaseous matter into space. The light and heat of the sun,
dispersed through space, slowly but continuously act upon the compound
gases with which space is universally pervaded to disassociate them
into their elements. The disassociated gases thus sucked in at the
solar poles at an extremely low temperature <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>are
brought into a state of combustion by friction and condensation, thus
generating new supplies of light and heat, and the gases thus reunited
by combustion are again projected into space, to be again slowly
disassociated by the operation of the sun&rsquo;s light and heat. The
result of this combustion is to form aqueous vapor and carbonic acid
and carbonic oxide, and these gases, when disassociated in space, are
resolved into carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, which again and again are
thus recombined and again and again decomposed as they pass over the
sun&rsquo;s surface (7).</p>
<p>The seven hypotheses above described are the only ones now in vogue,
and a brief analysis will show that no single one of them, nor all
combined, will give sufficient results to account for the essential
difficulties or known conditions of the problem. The first and second
hypotheses are answered by the fact set forth by Helmholtz (Popular
Scientific Lectures, article &ldquo;On the Origin of the Planetary
System&rdquo;), that, if the mass of the sun were composed of the two
elements capable by combination of producing the greatest possible
light and heat,&mdash;to wit, hydrogen and oxygen in the proportions in
which they unite to form water,&mdash;&ldquo;calculation shows that
under the above supposition the heat resulting from their combustion
would be sufficient to keep up the radiation of heat from the sun three
thousand and twenty-one years. That, it is true, is a long time, but
even profane history teaches that the sun has lighted and warmed us for
three thousand years, and geology puts it beyond doubt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>that
this period must be extended to millions of years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third hypothesis relates to <i>currents</i> of electricity. We
have no knowledge of currents of electricity which could produce,
however multiplied or intensified, such light and heat as are
constantly poured forth from the sun into all space. That electricity
is the intermediate cause of our sun&rsquo;s energy, and of all solar
energy, it is the purpose of this work to demonstrate, but not electric
<i>currents</i>, which find their attractiveness to theorists in the
vague suggestion of which Professor Proctor speaks, referring to
comets, in his article on &ldquo;Cometic Mysteries,&rdquo; &ldquo;that
perhaps <i>this</i> is an electrical phenomenon; perhaps <i>that other
feature</i> is electrical, too; perhaps <i>all or most</i> of the
phenomena of comets depend on electricity.&rdquo; But he adds,
&ldquo;It is so easy to make such suggestions, so difficult to obtain
evidence in their favor having the slightest scientific value. Still, I
hold the electrical idea to be well worth careful study. Whatever
credit may hereafter be given to any electrical theory of comets will
be solely and entirely due to those who may help to establish it upon a
basis of sound evidence,&mdash;none whatever to the mere suggestion,
which has been made time and again since it was first advanced by
Fontanelle.&rdquo; It will be seen that the present work, in
demonstrating the true source and mode of solar energy, in itself
presents a full and sufficient explanation of all the cometic mysteries
referred to, as well as all those pertaining to other solar systems in
space, and the multifarious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>phenomena which they present. Indeed,
the philosophic mind will not be satisfied with the sufficiency of any
hypothesis which will not unlock the mysteries and clearly explain the
phenomena of other systems,&mdash;of comets, variable and temporary
stars, double stars, and all the complicated celestial economy which to
the eye of the mere observer presents a bewildering scene of the
operation of independent and inscrutable forces. The fifth hypothesis
cited, that of meteoric impact, doubtless plays a part, as we know from
the generation of light and heat by the constant passage of similar
bodies through our own atmosphere. And we know, of course, that the
sun, by its vastly-increased attraction, must be subjected to the
constant impact of such meteoric bodies in enormous numbers. But the
fatal defect in the theory is that such impacts, to produce the radiant
energy of the sun, must constantly add to its mass in like proportion,
and as the motions and distances of the planets in their orbits are
regulated and preserved by virtue of the substantially constant mass of
the sun, any progressive and considerable increase in its mass must
constantly bring the planets nearer and nearer, and thus increase their
orbital velocity. Helmholtz quotes from Sir William Thomson&rsquo;s
investigation, that, &ldquo;assuming it to hold, the mass of the sun
should increase so rapidly that the consequences would have shown
themselves in the accelerated motion of the planets. The entire loss of
heat from the sun cannot, at all events, be produced in this way; at
the most a portion, which, however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>may not be
inconsiderable.&rdquo; R. Kalley Miller, in &ldquo;The Romance of
Astronomy,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;But more recent observations have led
Sir William Thomson to a modification of his theory. He has calculated
that if the meteoric shower were sufficiently heavy to make up for the
sun&rsquo;s whole expenditure of heat, the matter of the corona must be
so dense as seriously to perturb the orbits of certain comets which
pass very close to his surface,&mdash;a result which is found not to be
the case. But the meteoric theory is only thrown back a step. If the
sun&rsquo;s mass were originally formed, as is not at all improbable,
by the agglomeration of these particles, Sir William Thomson has
calculated that the heat generated by their thus falling together would
be sufficient to account for a supply of twenty million years of solar
heat at the present rate of emission. And thus, though the meteors are
not sufficient to maintain the energy of our system unimpaired, they
may yet have been the original storehouse from which all that energy
was derived&#8202;&hellip;. But if the economy of our system be spared
long enough, the day must come when the sun with age has become wan;
when the matter of the corona has all been drawn in and used up without
avail; when the lavish luxuriance with which he has showered abroad his
light and heat has finally exhausted all his stores. He has still
power, aided by the resisting medium, to drag his satellites one by one
down upon his surface; and the shock of each successive impact will,
for a brief period, give him a fresh tenure of life. When the earth
crashes into the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>sun it will supply him with a store of heat for
nearly a century, while Jupiter&rsquo;s large mass will extend the
period by nearly thirty thousand years. But when the last of the
planets is swallowed up, the sun&rsquo;s energies will rapidly die out
and a deep and deathly gloom gather about nature&rsquo;s grave. Looking
into the ages of a future eternity, we can see nothing but a cold and
burnt-out mass remaining of that glorious orb which went forth in the
morning of time, joyful as a bridegroom from his chamber, and rejoicing
as a strong man to run a race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sixth hypothesis is that to which most credence is now given. It
is that of evolution of energy by condensation of volume. Professor
Proctor (&ldquo;The Sun as a Perpetual Machine&rdquo;) says, &ldquo;In
company with this great mystery of seeming waste comes the yet more
difficult problem, how to explain the apparent continuance of solar
light and heat during millions of years. We know from the results of
geological research that the earth has been exposed to the action of
the solar rays with their present activity during at least a hundred
million years. Yet it is difficult to see how, on any hypothesis of the
generation of solar heat, or by combining together all possible modes
of heat generation, a supply for more than twenty millions of years in
the past and a possible supply for as long a period in the future can
be accounted for.&rdquo; Of these vast periods of terrestrial existence
in the past we quote the following from a recent publication:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor C. D. Wolcott expresses the opinion that geologic
time is not to be measured by hundreds of years, but simply by tens of
millions. This is widely different from the conclusion arrived at by
Sir Charles Lyell, who, basing his estimate on modifications of certain
specimens of marine life, assigned 240,000,000 years as the required
geological period; Darwin claimed 200,000,000 years; Crowell, about
72,000,000; Geike, from 73,000,000 upward; McGee, Upham, and other
recent authorities claim from 100,000,000 up to 680,000,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helmholtz (&ldquo;On the Origin of the Planetary System&rdquo;)
says, &ldquo;It is probable rather that a great part of this heat,
which was produced by condensation, began to radiate into space before
this condensation was complete. But the heat which the sun could have
previously developed by its condensation would have been sufficient to
cover its present expenditure for not less than 22,000,000 of years of
the past&#8202;&hellip;. We may therefore assume with great probability
that the sun will still continue in its condensation, even if it only
attained the density of the earth, though it will probably become far
denser in its interior, owing to its far greater pressure; this would
develop fresh quantities of heat, which would be sufficient to maintain
for an additional 17,000,000 of years the same intensity of sunshine as
that which is now the source of all terrestrial life.&rdquo; Of this
process of condensation Professor Ball, in his recent work, &ldquo;In
the High Heavens,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;It goes without saying that the
welfare of the human race is necessarily <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>connected with the
continuance of the sun&rsquo;s beneficent action. We have indeed shown
that the few other direct or indirect sources of heat which might
conceivably be relied upon are in the very nature of things devoid of
necessary permanence. It becomes, therefore, of the utmost interest to
inquire whether the sun&rsquo;s heat can be calculated on indefinitely.
Here is indeed a subject which is literally of the most vital
importance, so far as organic life is concerned. If the sun shall ever
cease to shine, then it must be certain that there is a term beyond
which human existence, or indeed organic existence of any type
whatever, cannot any longer endure on the earth. We may say once for
all that the sun contains just a certain number of units of heat,
actual or potential, and that he is at the present moment shedding that
heat around with the most appalling extravagance.&rdquo; Quoting from
Professor Langley, he says, &ldquo;We feel certain that the incessant
radiation from the sun must be producing a profound effect on its
stores of energy. The only way of reconciling this with the total
absence of evidence of the expected changes is to be found in the
supposition that such is the mighty mass of the sun, such the
prodigious supply of heat or what is the equivalent of heat which it
contains, that the grand transformation through which it is passing
proceeds at a rate so slow that, during the ages accessible to our
observations, the results achieved have been
imperceptible&#8202;&hellip;. We cannot, however, attribute to the sun
any miraculous power of generating heat. That great body cannot disobey
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>those laws which we have learned from experiments
in our laboratories. Of course no one now doubts that the great law of
the conservation of energy holds good. We do not in the least believe
that because the sun&rsquo;s heat is radiated away in such profusion it
is therefore entirely lost. It travels off, no doubt, to the depths of
space, and <i>as to what may become of it there we have no
information</i>. Everything we know points to the law that energy is as
indestructible as matter itself. The heat scattered from the sun exists
at least as <i>ethereal vibration, if in no other form</i>. But it is
most assuredly true that this energy, so copiously dispensed, is lost
to our solar system. There is no form in which it is returned, or in
which it can be returned. The energy of the system is as surely
declining as the store of energy of the clock declines according as the
weight runs down. In the clock, however, the energy is restored by
winding up the weight, but there is no analogous process known in our
system.&rdquo; The purpose of the present work, however, is to clearly
demonstrate that just such a process is actually being carried on, and
has been so carried on from the beginning, and will be forever. This
writer continues reviewing the suppositions formerly entertained, that
the sun was a heated body gradually cooling down, or that it was
undergoing absolute combustion, and shows that they were utterly
insufficient. He then refers to the theory of meteoric supply, of which
he says, &ldquo;It can, however, be shown that there are not enough
meteors in existence to supply a sufficient quantity of heat
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>to the sun to compensate the loss by radiation.
The indraught of meteoric matter may, indeed, certainly tend in some
small degree to retard the ultimate cooling of the great luminary, but
its effect is so small that we can quite afford to overlook it from the
point of view that we are taking in these pages. It is to Helmholtz we
are indebted for the true solution of the long-vexed problem. He has
demonstrated in the clearest manner where the source of the sun&rsquo;s
heat lies&#8202;&hellip;. A gaseous globe like the sun, when it parts
with its heat, observes laws of a very different type from those which
a cooling solid follows. As the heat disappears by radiation the body
contracts; the gaseous object, however, decreases in general much more
than a solid body would do for the same loss of heat&#8202;&hellip;.
The globe of gas unquestionably radiates heat and loses it, and the
globe, in consequence of that loss, shrinks to a smaller
size&#8202;&hellip;. In the facts just mentioned we have an explanation
of the sustained heat of the sun. Of course we cannot assume that in
our calculations the sun is to be treated as if it were gaseous
throughout its entire mass, but it approximates so largely to the
gaseous state in the greater part of its bulk that we can feel no
hesitation in adopting the belief that the true cause has been
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding the constitution of the sun, it may be stated, however,
that we only see its photosphere, which is the visible sun, and the
whole volume has a density about that of water; but no man has ever
seen the body of the sun itself. In this respect it is like the planet
Jupiter: we only know that its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>density cannot be less than
one-fourth the density of the earth&rsquo;s solid globe. If the
photosphere extend to a depth of one thousand, ten thousand, or a
hundred thousand miles, the density of the sun&rsquo;s body or core
will be correspondingly increased. Even computing the whole visible
volume, the density is far greater than that of any gas we know, even
with the solar pressure of gravity; with the sun&rsquo;s metallic
vapors, if the whole core were already vaporized, we would not, to say
the least, be likely to observe the sun-spots and other solar phenomena
as we find them actually to occur; this, however, will be more fully
considered later on. The author continues, &ldquo;But there is a
boundary to the prospect of the continuance of the sun&rsquo;s
radiation. Of course, as the loss of heat goes on the gaseous parts
will turn into liquids, and as the process is still further protracted
the liquids will transform into solids. Thus, we look forward to a time
when the radiation of the sun can be no longer carried on in conformity
with the laws which dictate the loss of heat from a gaseous body. When
this state is reached the sun may, no doubt, be an incandescent solid
with a brilliance as great as is compatible with that condition, but
the further loss of heat will then involve loss of
temperature&#8202;&hellip;. There seems no escape from the conclusion
that the continuous loss of solar heat must still go on, so that the
sun will pass through the various stages of brilliant incandescence, of
glowing redness, of dull redness, until it ultimately becomes a dark
and non-luminous star&#8202;&hellip;. There is thus a distinct
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>limit to man&rsquo;s existence on the earth,
dictated by the ultimate exhaustion of the sun&#8202;&hellip;. The
utmost amount of heat that it would ever have been possible for the sun
to contain would, according to this authority (Professor Langley),
supply its radiation for eighteen million years at the present
rate&#8202;&hellip;. It seems that the sun has already dissipated about
four-fifths of the energy with which it may have originally been
endowed. At all events, it seems that, radiating energy at its present
rate, the sun may hold out for four million years or for five million
years, but not for ten million years&#8202;&hellip;. We have seen that
it does not seem possible for any other source of heat to be available
for replenishing the waning stores of the luminary.&rdquo; He concludes
by saying that the original heat may have been imparted as the result
of some great collision, the solar body having itself been dark before
the collision occurred, and that it may be reinvigorated by a
repetition of a similar startling process, but indicates in general
terms that such an operation would be bad for the round world and all
contained therein. It would, in fact, be rough treatment for even a
hopeless case.</p>
<p>Condensation of the solar volume is unquestionably a source of heat,
for we know that the solid or liquid interior of the earth increases in
temperature at a definite ratio as we descend through its crust; but
long before the sun shall have become contracted to the density of the
earth all its heat will have become substantially internal heat, and it
can then supply no more by radiation to its surrounding planets.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>It will be seen that the radiant energy of the sun on any of the
above hypotheses is not sufficient to account even for the life period
of the earth in the past, and that its future period of energy must be
still more brief. Professor Ball (&ldquo;In the High Heavens&rdquo;),
basing his views on Laplace&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nebular Hypothesis,&rdquo;
says, &ldquo;Looking back into the remote ages, we thus see that the
sun was larger and larger the further back we project our view. If we
go sufficiently far back, we seem to come to a time when the sun, in a
more or less completely gaseous state, filled up the surrounding space
out to the orbit of Mercury, or, earlier still, out to the orbit of the
remotest planet.&rdquo; According to this hypothesis, all these
brilliant suns, the author says, will &ldquo;settle down into dark
bodies like the earth,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;every analogy would teach
us that the dark and non-luminous bodies in the universe are far more
numerous than the brilliant suns. We can never see the dark objects; we
can discern their presence only indirectly. All the stars that we can
see are merely those bodies which at this epoch of their career happen
for the time to be so highly heated as to be luminous&#8202;&hellip;.
It may happen that there are dark bodies in the vicinity of some of the
bright stars to which these stars act as illuminants, just in the same
way as the sun disperses light to the planets.&rdquo; One would
naturally suppose, however, that there must be some sort of laws to
govern such stupendous operations, and that nature is not merely
engaged in blowing bubbles. To quote Professor Newcomb: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>&ldquo;At the present time we can only say that
the nebular hypothesis is indicated by the general tendencies of the
laws of nature; that it has not been proved to be inconsistent with any
fact; that it is <i>almost a necessary consequence of the only theory
by which we can account for the origin and conservation of the
sun&rsquo;s heat</i>; but that it rests on the assumption that this
conservation is to be explained by the laws of nature as we now see
them in operation. Should any one be sceptical as to the sufficiency of
these laws to account for the present state of things, science can
furnish no evidence strong enough to overthrow his doubts until the sun
shall be found growing smaller by actual measurement, or the
nebul&aelig; be actually seen to condense into stars and
systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the validity of the views set forth in the present volume does
not depend on the sufficiency or insufficiency of the nebular
hypothesis, and in fact requires the condensation as well as the
expansion of the solar volume <i>under the influence of heat</i> to be
recognized and its extreme importance pointed out, yet it must not be
supposed that this great generalization of Kant and Laplace, based on
the views presented originally by Sir William Herschel, is established,
or that the difficulties in its way are not so enormous as to be almost
insuperable. Professor Ball points out that thousands of bodies occupy
our solar system, and together compose it as a whole; that these have
orbits of every sort of eccentricity and direction, and occupying all
possible planes which can pass through the sun; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>that the
bodies circle around the sun, some backward and others forward, and
that only the planets seem to conform to some common order; and without
this order, which may be accidental, so far as our knowledge goes, the
system would have been disrupted long since, if it ever could have
begun its operations; and that in this view the heavens may be strewn
with wrecks of systems which failed to survive from inherent want of
harmony,&mdash;that is to say, as based on observation only. Whether
the nebular hypothesis be a universal or a partial law of development,
or whether the real processes be quite different, cannot, however,
depend on the continued maintenance and evolution of the sun&rsquo;s
energy, as this source must in truth be sought for in quite a different
direction.</p>
<p>The remaining hypothesis (the seventh) is considered in detail in
Professor Proctor&rsquo;s work, &ldquo;Mysteries of Time and
Space.&rdquo; The fatal defect in Dr. Siemens&rsquo;s theory is, that
his gases will not be projected from the sun&rsquo;s equator. Professor
Proctor says, &ldquo;Thus the centripetal tendency of matter at the
sun&rsquo;s equator is very much greater (many hundreds of times
greater) than its centrifugal tendency, and there is not the slightest
possibility of matter being projected into space from the sun&rsquo;s
surface by centrifugal tendency. Nor is there any part of the
sun&rsquo;s mass where the centrifugal tendency is greater than at the
surface near the equator. So that, whatever else the sun may be doing
to utilize his mighty energies, he is certainly not throwing off matter
constantly from his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37"
name="pb37">37</a>]</span>equatorial regions, as Dr. Siemens&rsquo;s
theory requires.&rdquo; There are other difficulties which Professor
Proctor considers, such as the doubt as to the power of the sun&rsquo;s
rays to disassociate combined gases in space, and also that, since both
light and heat must be utilized in this work, if the sun&rsquo;s
energies are to be perpetually renewed, these forces would sensibly
disappear in work, and the result would be that the fixed stars would
be invisible beyond their domains, and their light, when not totally
cut off, would be greatly diminished, in any event, as distances
increased, which is not the case. Besides, these gases thus
disassociated could never be entirely used by the sun, and the
remainder would be wasted, and the part wasted would vastly exceed that
utilized, probably in as great proportion of waste as that of the
sun&rsquo;s light not utilized by the planets, which gather but one
two-hundred-and-thirty-two-millionths of the whole. It may be further
added that these gases would be mechanically mixed, the combined and
the disassociated, and this would be mostly the case in those parts
nearest the sun, so that large volumes of spent and useless gases would
have to be carried in to no purpose whatever. In fact, these gases
would gradually form a closed circuit of supply and discharge, and
surrounding space would be but slightly affected. Professor Proctor
concludes, &ldquo;We have, in fact, the fallacy of perpetual motion in
a modified form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be apparent that under any single one, or all, of these
hypotheses, the future prospect for created forms and continued
existence is hopeless, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38"
name="pb38">38</a>]</span>and that the inevitable result must do
violence to every conception of either an intelligent creative power or
the operations of universal law. The mind revolts from the continued
degradation and destruction of all organic creation, while the
malevolent and iconoclastic forces of nature hold high revel over final
ruin and eternal destruction, brought about by their own incessant
efforts, striking out blindly to make or mar, and they alone the
deathless survivors, the half-blind fates and furies of the eternal
future. It betokens, not the processes of orderly government, but the
reign of anarchy.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;Since this work has been in
press, at the annual meeting of the British Association, August 8,
1894, Lord Salisbury, the President, delivered a powerful and lucid
address on the present status of scientific knowledge and its
limitations. With reference to the antiquity of the earth we quote the
following: &ldquo;It is evident, from the increase of heat as we
descend into the earth, that the earth is cooling, and we know, by
experiment within certain wide limits, the rate at which its
substances&mdash;the matters of which it is constituted&mdash;are found
to cool. It follows that we can approximately calculate how hot it was
so many million years ago; but if at any time it was hotter at the
surface by fifty degrees Fahrenheit than it is now, life would then
have been impossible upon the planet, and, therefore, we can without
much difficulty fix a date before which organic life on earth cannot
have existed. Basing himself on these considerations, Lord Kelvin
limited the period of organic life upon the earth to a hundred million
years, and Professor Tait, in a still more penurious spirit, cut that
hundred down to ten.&rdquo; If a period of anything like ten million
years, even, has been requisite to cool the earth&rsquo;s surface only
fifty degrees in temperature, what time must have elapsed since the
terrestrial globe had a temperature high enough to effect the difficult
chemical combinations of many of the elements which compose its
structure? And even this must have been far less than the vast cycles
of time during which original consolidation was effected. Through all
these ages the sun must have been pouring out his radiant energy at at
least his present rate. Radiation of heat from the earth may have been
relatively less rapid from a denser carbon-laden atmosphere in times
past than at present, but it never could have been more so. The whole
address cited is, indeed, strongly corroborative of the facts upon
which the present work is based. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"

<h2 class="main">THE CONSTITUTION AND PHENOMENA OF THE SUN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The various theories thus reviewed, while not
sufficient in themselves to account for the facts of our own solar
system, are fatally defective in another respect. While they aim to
account for the sun&rsquo;s light and heat, they all fail to consider
the active medium of the solar light and heat in the sun itself. It is
not simply a highly-heated central mass glowing in space. It is a vast
orb surrounded by different envelopes of incandescent vapors or gases,
and by far the most vast in volume, as well as in light and
heat-radiating power, are the photosphere and its superincumbent
chromosphere, composed almost entirely of free hydrogen gas in a state
of intense incandescence. Whence comes this enormous mass of hydrogen?
And how explain the entire absence of free hydrogen gas from our own
atmosphere and its replacement by oxygen? There is a recent theory
propounded by Mr. A. Mott, which is set forth in detail in Professor
Ball&rsquo;s &ldquo;In the High Heavens,&rdquo; and which endeavors to
account for the remarkable absence of free hydrogen gas from the
earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, for, as the author states, &ldquo;It is a
singular fact that hydrogen in the free state is absent from our
atmosphere.&rdquo; The theory, in brief, is that the molecules of
hydrogen gas have an average speed of about a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>mile a
second,&mdash;which, however, is only one-seventh that required to
shoot them off into space,&mdash;but that these molecules are
continually changing their velocity, and may sometimes attain a speed
of seven miles a second; the result is that &ldquo;every now and then a
molecule of hydrogen succeeds in bolting away from the earth altogether
and escaping into open space.&rdquo; During past ages the molecules of
hydrogen would thus have gradually wiggled up through the air, and
finally disappeared into outer darkness for good and all; and thus
&ldquo;the fact that there is at present no free hydrogen in the air
over our heads may be accounted for.&rdquo; Since the molecules of
oxygen have only a velocity of a quarter mile a second, that
unfortunate gas remains behind and is consumed.</p>
<p>The first difficulty with this theory is to explain how, if the
hydrogen wiggled off in this unceremonious manner, it ever wiggled on.
There is no objection to a gait of this rapidity, however; it is highly
creditable, in fact; but we have a right to expect some degree of
consistency in even so light-headed a body as hydrogen gas. The article
quoted thus continues: &ldquo;If the mass of the earth were very much
larger than it is, then the velocities with which the molecules of
hydrogen wend their way would never be sufficiently high to enable them
to quit the earth altogether, and consequently we might in such a case
expect to find our atmosphere largely charged with hydrogen.&rdquo; It
will be seen that, according to this theory, hydrogen is able to
achieve a speed of seven miles per second under exceptional
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>excitement, and that this molecular velocity is
just enough, and no more than enough, to give it egress. We know that
Jupiter&rsquo;s mass is three hundred times as great as that of the
earth, and the attraction of gravity is so powerful on the surface of
that planet that, as the writer just quoted says, &ldquo;Walking, or
even standing, would involve the most fearful exertion, while rising
from bed in the morning would be a difficult, indeed, probably, an
impossible, process.&rdquo; We also know that the atmosphere of this
planet is laden with enormous clouds floating at various altitudes and
with incessant movements. We are told that &ldquo;the molecular speed
of aqueous vapor averages only one-third of that attained by the
molecules of hydrogen.&rdquo; Of course, on the planet Jupiter,
hydrogen would have no chance of escape at all: it would just have to
stay and take it, like the rest of us. Jupiter must thus have an
atmosphere like our own, except that it is &ldquo;largely charged with
hydrogen.&rdquo; Of the clouds upon this planet, Professor Ball says,
&ldquo;In fact, the longer we look at Jupiter the more we become
convinced that the surface of the planet is swathed with a mighty
volume of clouds so dense and so impenetrable that our most powerful
telescopes have never yet been able to pierce through them down to the
solid surface of the planet.&rdquo; With the densities, molecular
velocities, and specific gravity of the oxygen, nitrogen, and the
hydrogen, with which latter the atmosphere of Jupiter must be
&ldquo;largely charged,&rdquo; as it is said, it is difficult to
understand how such enormous clouds of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>aqueous vapors,
themselves composed of oxygen, which is a very slow-footed gas, and
hydrogen, could travel about with such facility; we ought to find them
packed down like London fog, to say the least, upon the surface of that
planet, with the supernatant gases all adrift overhead. Jupiter is a
hot body; it has not yet cooled down; and if it is provided with
volcanoes, such as its great red spot and the analogies of the earth
and moon would suggest, we can tell pretty nearly what would have
happened long ago with a Jovian atmosphere like ours; but
&ldquo;largely charged with hydrogen,&rdquo; if we compare it with,
say, an equal mass of dynamite touched off by a volcanic explosion;
there would not have been enough of old Jupiter left to swear by, and
what was left would not have had any atmosphere at all. On Mars, the
same writer thinks the oxygen would still cling, like the fragrance of
the rose, but that all the molecules of the fleet-footed and excitable
hydrogen would long since have taken French leave, as it did from the
earth; but at the moon, on account of its small size and mass, both
gases would have gone off incontinently together. &ldquo;It is now
easy,&rdquo; the author says, &ldquo;to account for the absence of
atmosphere from the moon&#8202;&hellip;. Neither of the gases, oxygen
or nitrogen, to say nothing of hydrogen, could possibly exist in the
free state on a globe of the mass and dimensions of our
satellite&#8202;&hellip;. Indeed, the weight of every object on the
moon would be reduced to the sixth part of that which the same object
has on earth.&rdquo; Nevertheless, it may be said that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>moon has
considerable weight, as weights go, but with a comet it is quite a
different matter. &ldquo;These bodies,&rdquo; the author says,
&ldquo;demonstrate conclusively that the quantity of matter even in a
comet is extremely small when compared with its bulk. The conclusion
thus arrived at is confirmed by the fact that our efforts to obtain the
weight of a comet have hitherto proved unsuccessful&#8202;&hellip;. It
has thus been demonstrated that, notwithstanding the stupendous bulk of
a great comet, its mass must have been so inconsiderable as to have
been insufficient to disturb even such unimportant members of the solar
system as the satellites of Jupiter.&rdquo; Now, here is a state of
things; for the spectroscope shows that comets are fully provided with
a large supply of hydrogen, enough and to spare for ornament, even, and
of nitrogen also, while it is the abnormally fugacious oxygen which
has, apparently, taken its departure. Of course, such facts demonstrate
the untenability of the theory, which is, besides, in direct
contradiction with the laws governing gaseous diffusion. Gases pass
into each other with the same velocity as into a vacuum, and it is not
to be imagined that the molecules of hydrogen could thus move
individually off, unless forced upward by the pressure of some other
gas, which the law of gaseous diffusion makes impossible. We should as
readily expect to see a tumbler full of iron balls, into the
interstices of which loose sand has been poured, manifest a similar
phenomenon by the wiggling out of the less dense sand at the top of the
glass. One might also ask whence, if <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>this theory had any
substantial basis, could come the enormous volumes of hydrogen gas in
the atmosphere of a new or temporary star, in a few hours, or the
changes manifested in the atmospheres of the variable stars. So, also,
the nebular or any other hypothesis of creation would be impossible
under this theory, as the heavier and less mobile gaseous elements
would remain behind, or be condensed nearest the center of gravity of
the aggregating nebula, while the more rapid gases would disappear
outwardly, and in consequence the sun would be found to be composed of
the heavier elements exclusively, and each of the planets, in turn,
would consist of only one or two elements, in accordance with the more
and more mobile character of their molecular movements, and the
uniformity of chemical constitution between the sun and planets, as
well as the fixed stars, would not be found to exist. The theory, in
fact, is an example of the endeavor to explain an easily understood
difficulty by a less easily understood impossibility.</p>
<p>None of the different theories even attempt to account for the
prodigious volumes of hydrogen in the solar atmosphere, and without its
presence the sun, so far as we know, would be almost an inert mass,
considered as a source of energy for the supply of our planetary
system. We know, of course, that meteors contain sometimes as much as
six volumes of gases, largely composed of hydrogen, at our own
atmospheric pressure. But the pressure at the sun&rsquo;s surface is
more than twenty-seven times that at the surface of the earth, and yet
the volume <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>of hydrogen there existing visibly is vaster
beyond computation than any possible mass of meteoric material could
supply. So, also, while it may be granted that condensation of volume
must vastly raise the solar temperature, how could it produce the
enormous masses of hydrogen, the lightest of all the elements, unless
they have been temporarily occluded and finally thrown out from within,
which is impossible? These vast volumes of hydrogen are to be
considered first of all in any attempt whatever to solve the problem of
the source and mode of solar energy.</p>
<p>Considering the phenomena presented within the limits of our own
solar system alone, we find that the earth is one of a single family of
planets, each of which very closely resembles it, and all of which
circle, in slightly elliptical orbits, at various distances around the
sun, their orbits occupying substantially the same plane, thus making
our solar system a flat disk of space occupied by the sun as a center,
with the planets and their satellites moving harmoniously around it.
The planets differ from each other in size, mass, and temperature, but
each is surrounded by an envelope of aqueous vapor, suspended in an
atmosphere substantially like our own. Professor Proctor, in his
&ldquo;Light Science for Leisure Hours,&rdquo; says of the planet
Jupiter, &ldquo;His real surface is always veiled by his dense and
vapor-laden atmosphere. Saturn, Venus, and Mercury are similarly
circumstanced.&rdquo; Of Mars he says that it is &ldquo;distinctly
marked (in telescopes of sufficient power) with continents and oceans
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>are rarely concealed by vapors.&rdquo; Now, whence
comes this aqueous vapor surrounding all the planets? Whether received
originally from the diffused nebular mass from which our solar system
is supposed to have been condensed, or attracted by the force of
gravity from interplanetary space, like the meteors which fall upon the
earth&rsquo;s surface, it is evident that interplanetary space must
once have been pervaded with aqueous vapor, since the nebular mass from
which our solar system was constituted must have occupied at least the
space embraced within its largest planetary orbit, and doubtless much
more; and if so, such aqueous vapor, and other vapors also, must still
persist in space, just as the meteoric particles which so constantly
manifest themselves in our atmosphere. If the planets had no common
origin, the evidence is equally conclusive, since then this identical
substance could only have been derived from a common source, which can
only be interplanetary space. This also is in accordance with the laws
of attraction, which would operate to gather and condense the rarefied
aqueous vapor of space around the planetary masses in definite
proportions. In his &ldquo;Familiar Essays on Scientific
Subjects,&rdquo; Professor Proctor says, &ldquo;In fact, we do thus
recognize in the spectra of Mars, Venus, and other planets the presence
of aqueous vapor in their atmosphere;&rdquo; and in his
&ldquo;Mysteries of Time and Space&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;We may admit
the possibility that the aqueous vapor and carbon compounds are present
in stellar or interplanetary space.&rdquo; But in addition to this
aqueous vapor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>which surrounds the planetary bodies, we find free
oxygen in vast quantities, and, with this, free nitrogen in mechanical
admixture, and these together constitute the atmosphere we breathe, and
which sustains organic life by a process of slow combustion. But we
find no free hydrogen either in our own atmosphere or in that of other
planets. Turning now to the sun, we find that it is surrounded by an
atmosphere as well as the planets, but that this atmosphere is composed
not of free oxygen, but of free hydrogen. In his article, &ldquo;Oxygen
in the Sun,&rdquo; Professor Proctor says, &ldquo;Fourteen only of the
elements known to us, or less than a quarter of the total number, were
thus found to be present in the sun&rsquo;s constitution; and of these
all were metals, if we regard hydrogen as metallic&#8202;&hellip;. But
most remarkable of all, and most perplexing, was the absence of all
trace of oxygen and nitrogen, two gases which could not be supposed
wanting in the substance of the great ruling center of the planetary
system.&rdquo; The researches of Dr. Draper indicated, however, that
oxygen could be found in the sun; not in his external atmosphere but
far down within his surface. Professor Proctor says, &ldquo;Dr. Draper
mentions that he has found no traces of oxygen above the
photosphere.&rdquo; Such free oxygen cannot be associated with the
hydrogen, however, even if its presence be finally determined, but it
may be due to the deoxidation of solid compounds precipitated upon the
sun from space, and held at a temperature above that of disassociation,
as hydrogen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>is sometimes generated at the surface of the
earth.</p>
<p>The vast mass of the solar atmosphere is composed of hydrogen gas,
with which are found commingled vapors of the various elements which
enter into the sun&rsquo;s constitution, and this solar atmosphere
corresponds in proportion, speaking generally, with our own atmosphere,
except that the volume of solar hydrogen is vastly greater than that of
terrestrial oxygen, for the reason, as will be explained, that water
contains two volumes of the former to one of the latter.</p>
<p>In Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia the sun is thus described,
(article by Professors Langley and Proctor): &ldquo;To sum up briefly
the received hypotheses of the physical constitution of the sun: of its
internal structure we know nothing, but we can infer, from the low
density of the solar globe as a whole, that no considerable portion is
solid or liquid. The regions we examine appear to consist of cloud
layers at several levels floating in a complex atmosphere, in which
probably most of the elements are known to us, and certainly many of
them exist in the form of vapor. Outside this complex atmosphere extend
envelopes of simpler constitution, though into them occasionally arise
the vapors which ordinarily lie lower down. The sierra, for instance,
consists in the main of glowing hydrogen gas and that gas, whatever it
may be, which produces the line near the orange-yellow sodium lines.
The prominence region may be regarded as simply the extension of the
sierra.&rdquo; Of these prominences, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>Professor Ball says,
&ldquo;The memorable discovery made by Janssen and Lockyer,
independently, in 1868, showed that the prominences could be observed
without the help of an eclipse, by the happy employment of the peculiar
refrangibility of the rosy light which these prominences
emit&#8202;&hellip;. We can now obtain, not, as heretofore, merely
isolated views of special prominences through the widely opened slit of
the spectroscope, but we are furnished, after a couple of
minutes&rsquo; exposure, with a complete photograph of the prominences
surrounding the sun&#8202;&hellip;. The incandescent region of the
chromosphere from which these prominences arise is also recorded with
accuracy.&rdquo; Resuming our quotation from Appleton&rsquo;s
Cyclop&aelig;dia: &ldquo;The inner corona is still simpler than the
sierra, so far as its gaseous constitution is concerned; but here
meteoric and cometic matter appears, extending to the outer corona and
to great distances beyond even the visible limits of the zodiacal.
Returning to the photosphere, we find it subject to continual
fluctuations, both from local causes of agitation and from the
subjacent vapor acting by its elasticity to burst through it; the
facul&aelig;, which are found to be above the general level of the
photosphere, are taken to be heapings up of the luminous matter like
the crested surges of the sea. All the strata are subject to great
movements, which sometimes have the character of uniform progression
analogous to our trade-winds, and sometimes are violent, and resemble
in their effects our tornadoes and whirlwinds. Eruptive action appears
to operate from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>time to time with exceeding violence, but whether
the enormous velocities of outrush are due to true explosive action
(which would compel us to believe that the sun is enclosed by a liquid
shell, so as to resemble a gigantic bubble) or to the uprising of
lighter vapors from enormous depths, as heated currents rise in our own
atmosphere, is not as yet certainly known.&rdquo; The sierra, or
chromosphere, is thus described in the same article: &ldquo;The sierra
presents four aspects: 1, smooth with defined outline; 2, smooth but
with no defined outline; 3, fringed with filaments; and, 4, irregularly
fringed with small flames. The prominences may be divided into three
orders,&mdash;heaps, jets, and plumes. The heaped prominences need no
special description. The jets &hellip; originate generally in
rectilinear jets either vertical or oblique, very bright and very well
defined. They rise to a great height, often to a height of at least
eighty thousand miles, and occasionally to more than twice that; then
bending back, fall again upon the sun like the jets of our fountains.
Then they spread into figures resembling gigantic trees more or less
rich in branches. Their luminosity is intense, insomuch that they can
be seen through the light clouds into which the sierra breaks up. Their
spectrum indicates the presence of many elements besides hydrogen. When
they have reached a certain height they cease to grow, and become
transformed into exceedingly bright masses, which eventually separate
into fleecy clouds. The jet prominences last but a short
time&mdash;rarely an hour, frequently but a few minutes,&mdash;and they
are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>only to be seen in the neighborhood of the spots.
Wherever there are jet prominences there also are facul&aelig;. The
plume prominences are distinguished from the jets in not being
characterized by any signs of an eruptive origin. They often extend to
an enormous height; they last longer than the jets, though subject to
rapid changes of figure; and, lastly, they are distributed
indifferently over the sun&rsquo;s surface. It would seem that in the
jets a part of the photosphere is lifted up, whereas in the case of
plumes only the sierra is disturbed.&rdquo; Of these eruptions
Professor Ball says, &ldquo;Vast masses of vapors are frequently
expelled from the interior of the sun by convulsive throes with a speed
of three hundred, four hundred, and sometimes nearly a thousand miles a
second&#8202;&hellip;. The spectroscope enables the observer actually
to witness the ascent of these solar prominences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corona, which extends beyond the chromosphere, has been
determined by its continuous spectrum to be a vast envelope extending
at least a million miles from the sun&rsquo;s surface. &ldquo;It cannot
be a solar atmosphere,&rdquo; Professor Proctor observes in his article
on this subject, in his &ldquo;Mysteries of Time and
Space.&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;It will be seen, then, how inconceivably
great the pressure exerted by a solar atmosphere some eight thousand
times as deep as ours would necessarily be, let the nature of the gases
composing it be what it may.&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;If a man could be
placed on the solar surface, his own weight would crush him as
effectually as though while on earth a weight of a couple of tons were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>heaped upon him&#8202;&hellip;. Now, it happens
that we know quite well that the pressure exerted by the real solar
atmosphere, even close by the bright surface which forms the visible
globe of the sun, is nothing like so great as it would be if the corona
formed part of that atmosphere.&rdquo; In the article
&ldquo;Sun,&rdquo; in Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia, it is stated
that &ldquo;Mr. Arthur W. Wright, of Yale College, has succeeded in
showing that this light (the zodiacal) is not emitted from incandescent
gas, but reflected from particles or small bodies, and hence derived
from the sun.&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;There is reason to believe that the
true solar corona extends much farther (than a million miles), and
that, in reality, the zodiacal light forms the outer part of the solar
corona.&rdquo; Proctor, again, in his article on the corona, says,
&ldquo;It would seem to follow that the corona is due to bodies of some
sort travelling around the sun, and by their motion preserved either
from falling towards him (in which case the corona would quickly
disappear) or from producing any pressure upon his surface, as an
atmosphere would.&rdquo; In his article on &ldquo;The Sun as a
Perpetual Machine,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;There is every reason for
regarding the zodiacal as consisting in the main of meteorolithic
masses, a sort of cosmical dust, rushing through interplanetary space
with planetary velocities. To such matter, assuming, as we well may,
that space really is occupied by attenuated vapors, &hellip; the
luminosity of the zodiacal would be attributable to particles of dust
emitting light reflected by the sun or by phosphorescence (this last
may be seriously <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>questioned). But there is another cause for
luminosity of these particles which may deserve a passing
consideration. Each particle would be electrified by gaseous friction
in its acceleration, and its electric tension would be vastly increased
in its forcible removal, in the same way as the fine dust of the desert
has been observed by Werner Siemens to be in a state of high
electrification on the apex of the Cheops Pyramid. Would not the
zodiacal light also find explanation by slow electric discharges
backward from the dust towards the sun?&rdquo; It may be observed in
passing that such electrical glow is much more prominently, and more
likely to be, the result of induction than of friction. In the article
&ldquo;Sun,&rdquo; previously quoted, Professor Young says,
&ldquo;There is surrounding the sun, beyond any further reasonable
doubt, a mass of self-luminous gaseous matter, whose spectrum is
characterized by the green line 1474 Kirchhoff. The precise extent of
this it is hardly possible to consider as determined, but it must be
many times the thickness of the red hydrogen portion of the sierra,
perhaps, on an average, 8&prime; or 10&prime;, with occasional horns of
twice that height. It is not at all unlikely that it may even turn out
to have no upper limit, but to extend from the sun indefinitely into
space.&rdquo; In the same article the sun&rsquo;s apparent diameter is
placed at about 32&prime;, so that the thickness of the above gaseous
envelope would be not less than one-fourth the sun&rsquo;s diameter, or
more than two hundred thousand miles. This coronal envelope, extending
out from the solar body until gradually merged into the attenuated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>matter of space, has a light so feeble that it can
only be clearly observed during total eclipse. Professor Ball
(&ldquo;In the High Heavens&rdquo;) says, &ldquo;The sunlight is so
intense that if it be reduced sufficiently by any artifice, the coronal
light also suffers so much abatement that, owing to its initial
feebleness, it ceases altogether to be visible.&rdquo; During the great
eclipse of 1893 it was photographed, and of these photographs the same
author says, &ldquo;One of the most remarkable features in the
structure of the corona is the presence of streamers or luminous rays
extending from the north and south poles of the sun. <i>These rays are
generally more or less curved</i>, and it is doubtful whether the
phenomena they exhibit are not in some way a consequence of the
rotation of the sun. This consideration is connected with the question
as to how far the corona itself shares in that rotation of the sun with
which astronomers are familiar. I should perhaps rather have said that
rotation of the sun&rsquo;s photosphere which, as the sun-spots prove,
is accomplished once every twenty-five days. Even this shell of
luminous matter does not revolve as a rigid mass would do. By some
mysterious law the equatorial portions accomplish their revolution in a
shorter period than is required by those zones of the photosphere which
lie nearer the north and south poles of the luminary. As to how the
parts of the sun which are interior to the photosphere may revolve, we
are quite ignorant&#8202;&hellip;. We have no means of knowing to what
extent the corona shares in the rotation. It would seem certain that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>the lower parts which lie comparatively near the
surface must be affected by the rapid rotation of the photosphere; but
it is very far from certain that this rotation can be shared to any
great extent by those parts of the corona which lie at a distance from
the sun&rsquo;s surface as great as the solar radius or
diameter&#8202;&hellip;. The corona presents a curious green line that
seems to denote some invariable constituent of the sun&rsquo;s outer
atmosphere, but the element to which this green line owes its origin is
wholly unknown.&rdquo; The same author quotes from Dr. Huggins as
follows: &ldquo;It is interesting to read what Dr. Huggins has to tell
us about the solar corona. The nature of this marvellous appendage to
the sun is still a matter of uncertainty. There can, however, be no
doubt that the corona consists of highly-attenuated matter <i>driven
outward from the sun by some repulsive force</i>, and it is also clear
that if this force be not electric, it must at least be something of a
very kindred character&#8202;&hellip;. So far as the spectrum of the
corona is concerned, we may summarize what is known in the words of Dr.
Huggins: &lsquo;The green coronal line has no known representative in
terrestrial substances, nor has Schuster been able to recognize any of
our elements in the other lines of the corona.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; The
account given by General Myer&mdash;quoted in Professor Proctor&rsquo;s
article, &ldquo;The Sun&rsquo;s Corona&rdquo;&mdash;of the great
eclipse of 1869, as viewed from an altitude of five thousand five
hundred feet above sea-level, is as follows: &ldquo;As a centre stood
the full and intensely black disk of the moon, surrounded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>by an
aureola of soft bright light, through which shot out, as if from the
circumference of the moon, straight, massive silvery rays, seeming
distinct and separate from each other, to a distance of two or three
diameters of the lunar disk; the whole spectacle showing as upon a
background of diffused rose-colored light. The silvery rays were
longest and most prominent at four points of the circumference,
&hellip; apparently equidistant from each other. There was no motion of
the rays: they seemed concentric.&rdquo; Three diameters would make
these rays extend two and a half million miles at least from the
sun&rsquo;s photosphere, or even its chromosphere. The coincidence
between these rays and those observed (see above) in the eclipse of
1893 must be noted, since these latter were conceived at one time to be
meteor streams. As those seen in 1893 radiated from the poles, and were
curved in form, while those last noted radiated at four equidistant
points, none polar, and were straight, it will be seen that, if both
phenomena were of the same class, they could not have been due to
meteor streams.</p>

<p>The sun&rsquo;s spots, which we will next refer to, are deep,
relatively dark, but in fact extremely bright depressions in the
photosphere. &ldquo;Many spots are of enormous size&rdquo; (see
article, &ldquo;Sun&rdquo;); &ldquo;one had a diameter exceeding fifty
thousand miles, and many far larger than this have been seen. The spots

name="pb58">58</a>]</span>the <i>umbra</i>, within which is a still
darker part called the <i>nucleus</i>, while around this there is a
fringe of fainter shade than the umbra, called the <i>penumbra</i>.
Although the umbra and nucleus appear dark, however, it is not to be
supposed that they are really dark; &hellip; though the nucleus looks
perfectly black by contrast with the general surface, it shines in
reality with a light unbearably brilliant when viewed alone, while his
thermal measurements show that the heat from the nucleus is even
greater proportionately than the light, and not very greatly below the
heat of the surrounding surface&#8202;&hellip;. The recognition of a
nucleus within the umbra would seem to indicate that a third cloud
layer (besides the outer or photosphere and a darker cloud layer
beneath) exists within the second or internal layer of Herschel&rsquo;s
theory. But the observations of Professor Langley show that most
probably all the features of the solar photosphere yet observed are
phenomena of cloud envelopes, since he has been able to recognize cloud
forms at one level floating over cloud forms at a lower level, while
even in the (relatively) darkest depths of the nucleus clouds are still
to be perceived, though so deep down that their outlines can be barely
discerned.&rdquo; Professor Ball says of the heat-wave of 1892,
&ldquo;As to the activity of the sun during the past summer, a very
striking communication has recently been made by one of the most rising
American astronomers, Mr. George E. Hale, of Chicago. He has invented
an ingenious apparatus for photographing on the same plate at one
exposure both the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59"
name="pb59">59</a>]</span>bright spots and the protuberances of the
sun&#8202;&hellip;. On the 15th of July a photograph of the sun showed
a large spot. Another photograph taken in a few minutes exhibited a
bright band; twenty-seven minutes later a further exposure displayed an
outburst of brilliant facul&aelig; all over the spot. At the end of an
hour the facul&aelig; had all vanished and the spot was restored to its
original condition. It was not a mere coincidence that our magnetic
observatories exhibited considerable disturbances the next day, and
that brilliant auroras were noted.&rdquo; Carrington&rsquo;s
observations have shown that spots in different solar latitudes travel
at different rates. &ldquo;Taking two parts of the visible solar
surface in the same longitude, but one in latitude forty-five degrees
(say), the other on the equator, the latter will advance farther and
farther in longitude from the former, gaining daily about two degrees,
so that in the course of about one hundred and eighty days it will have
gained a complete revolution. That is to say, the sun&rsquo;s equator
makes about two revolutions more per annum than regions in forty-five
degrees north and south solar latitude.&rdquo; The sun is about 850,000
miles in diameter; its density is one-fourth that of the earth; its
mass is 316,000 times greater, and its volume 1,253,000. Gravity at its
surface is 27.1 times that of the earth; its distance is approximately
92,000,000 miles; it rotates upon its axis, which is inclined to the
planetary plane at an angle of seven degrees, once in twenty-five and
one-third days, apparently increased to thirty days by the
earth&rsquo;s orbital advance in the same direction <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>around
the sun; and it has a motion around its center,&mdash;a true orbital
motion,&mdash;due to displacement by gravity of the planetary masses,
which, however, is always within its own mass.</p>

<p>The above, in brief, is, so far as we know, the constitution of the
sun and its appendages. Its internal globe is surrounded by a glowing
gaseous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>envelope, the photosphere, which is the visible
orb, composed of cloud masses of glowing hydrogen gas intermingled with
vapors of many of our terrestrial elements, all in a state of apparent
disassociation. Of the constitution of the sun&rsquo;s mass, Professor
Ball says, &ldquo;Professor Rowland has shown that thirty-six
terrestrial elements are certainly indicated in the solar spectrum,
while eight others are doubtful. Fifteen elements have not been found,
though sought for, and ten elements have not yet been compared with the
sun&rsquo;s spectrum. Reasons are also given for showing that, though
fifteen elements had no lines corresponding to those shown in the solar
spectrum, yet there is but little evidence to show that they are really
absent from the sun. Dr. Huggins epitomizes these very interesting
results in the striking remark, &lsquo;It follows that if the whole
earth were heated to the temperature of the sun, its spectrum would
resemble very closely the solar spectrum.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; Outside
the photosphere is the simpler chromosphere, composed largely of
hydrogen, and merging into the corona at a distance of hundreds of
thousands of miles from the sun&rsquo;s apparent surface, and this
corona extends outward to a vast distance, and is itself largely
composed of self-luminous matter, the action of gravity being
counterbalanced by the centrifugal force of orbital rotation, or more
probably by electrical repulsion. The metallic vapors in the
sun&rsquo;s photosphere are suspended in glowing hydrogen, which vastly
preponderates over all the others in mass and volume, the incandescence
of which is the principal source <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>of solar light and heat. The
planets revolve in elliptical orbits around this central sun, and
crossing these orbits at various angles rush streams of cometic matter
and comets and meteoric bodies, in streams and clouds, which, swiftly
sweeping around at various distances, are again thrown off into space.
Meteors constantly fall into the sun&rsquo;s mass, as they do upon the
earth; but the grand key-note of all his life and energy, so far as we
can perceive, is the vast envelope of glowing hydrogen gas.</p>
<p>Conversely, the planetary envelopes are of relatively cool oxygen
mixed with nitrogen gas, which hold in suspension diffused aqueous
vapors. If our own aqueous vapors are derived by the attraction of
gravity from the interplanetary space, as they must have been, we can
be sure that, were the sun at a sufficiently low temperature, he, too,
would gather to himself a surrounding envelope of aqueous vapor, larger
than our own in proportion to his mass, and larger than that of all the
planets together, the combined mass of which he exceeds by seven
hundred and fifty times. We should also expect similar aggregations of
aqueous vapors to surround all the fixed stars in proportion to their
various masses, yet we do not find aqueous vapor there, but hydrogen
instead. And in the distant telescopic nebul&aelig; we still find
hydrogen and nitrogen; even in the comets we find free hydrogen in vast
predominance, but not free oxygen; so that we may roughly divide the
bodies of stellar space into two grand categories,&mdash;those with
atmospheres of hydrogen and those with atmospheres of oxygen.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>It is true that the latter are limited to the
planets of our own system, so far as direct observation goes, for we
cannot see such dark planets as exist beyond our own solar system; but
if such planets exist, as they must, for reasons stated later on, and
revolve around their own central suns, we may infer, with the strength
of demonstration almost, that if their suns correspond to our sun in
this respect, their planets will correspond to our planets in a similar
respect. But the bodies with atmospheres of oxygen are those which
rotate around the sun substantially as a center, while with reference
to themselves the sun is more or less a fixed body in space. It is true
that our whole system is drifting through space, at present in the
direction of the constellation Lyra, and directly away from that
portion of space occupied by Sirius and Canopus, with an annual motion
of probably hundreds of millions of miles. Professor Ball (&ldquo;In
the High Heavens&rdquo;) says, &ldquo;In conclusion, it would seem that
the sun and the whole solar system are bound on a voyage to that part
of the sky which is marked by the star Delta Lyr&aelig;. It also
appears that the speed with which this motion is urged is such as to
bring us every day about 700,000 miles nearer to this part of the sky.
In one year the solar system accomplishes a journey of no less than
250,000,000 miles.&rdquo; A speed of eight miles per second gives an
annual rate of 252,288,000 miles. This speed, however, is greatly
exceeded by many stars (as determined by displacement of the lines of
the spectrum); the star No. 1830, of Groombridge&rsquo;s catalogue (see
&ldquo;In the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>High Heavens&rdquo;), has a rate of two hundred
miles per second. The author says, &ldquo;Indeed, in some cases stellar
velocities are attained which appear to be even greater than that just
mentioned. We do not, therefore, make any extravagant supposition in
adopting a speed of twenty miles per second,&rdquo; which he takes as
the average. &ldquo;I have adopted this particular velocity as fairly
typical of sidereal motions generally. It is rather larger than the
speed with which the earth moves in its orbit.&rdquo; The distances, of
course, are equally enormous. This author says, &ldquo;The nearest
star, as far as we yet know, in the northern hemisphere is 61
Cygni&#8202;&hellip;. I think we cannot be far wrong in adopting a
value of fifty millions of millions of miles&#8202;&hellip;. In the
course of a million years a star with the average speed of twenty miles
a second would move over a distance which was about a dozen times as
great as the distance between 61 Cygni and the solar system.&rdquo;
This assuming that the solar system is at rest, which is not the case,
as the author says, &ldquo;Unless binary, stars do not remain in
proximity, so far as we know; the general rule appears to be that of
universal movement through space.&rdquo; This drift through space,
however, no more affects the terms of the problem than the rotation of
the earth upon its axis or its orbital motion affects the operations of
an electric machine as the handle may be rotated to or from the
direction of these motions. Both machine and reservoir of energy
occupying a fixed relation with reference to each other, the positions
of each are the same as though <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65"
href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>absolutely fixed. This is true
of gravitation, likewise, as well as of all other natural and universal
forces.</p>
<p>The fact established, then, that attenuated aqueous vapor is
diffused throughout the interplanetary space occupied by our own solar
system, and that it tends to surround our sun and planetary bodies with
aqueous envelopes of increased density, proportionate to the action of
gravity, the question arises, Is there any known force which will act
through such interplanetary space to decompose such aqueous vapor into
its constituent elements and deposit hydrogen gas around the sun and
oxygen gas around the planets, and which, while maintaining a planetary
temperature such as we find on the planets, will at the same time raise
the hydrogen envelope of the sun to such a temperature of incandescence
that it will become a glowing sphere of heated hydrogen, in which other
constituents of the sun&rsquo;s mass will be raised to incandescence
and partially volatilized in the intense heat of that incandescent gas;
in which, in fact, the phenomena of the sun will become manifest? If
so, two vastly important corollaries are inevitable: first, that the
fixed stars, which also shine with the light of their own glowing
hydrogen, are themselves surrounded by a similar aqueous vapor,
diffused through their own adjacent space, and that, in consequence,
not only our own planetary distances, but all interstellar space, as
far as the utmost distance of the faintest fixed stars, is likewise
pervaded by the same attenuated aqueous vapor, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>that
this is the grand source from which is derived all solar energy, not
only of our own sun, but of all the other flaming orbs of space; and,
second, which is still more important to us as citizens of the
universe, that each flaming hydrogen sun must have surrounding it a
correlative dark planetary system of its own, and that the complement
of glowing hydrogen, as an incandescent envelope of the central orb,
necessitates the corresponding supplement of cool oxygen as an envelope
for each of such planetary bodies; in other words, that without such
planets as our system possesses, there can be no suns such as our own
and the other suns we see. Vast orbs might be conceived of as rotating
in eternal darkness without associated satellites, but the incandescent
atmosphere of hydrogen must have&mdash;not may have, but must
have&mdash;subordinate planets substantially similar to ours,
surrounded by atmospheres substantially similar to our own (for we find
free nitrogen in comets, in meteorites, and in the faintest
nebul&aelig;), and these planets are thus fitted, so far as we can
know, for the support of organic life and for the same orderly courses
of nature as we see manifest around us. They must be cool, for at the
planetary poles there must be a moderate temperature in contrast with
the solar pole, which becomes, of necessity, highly heated; they must
have an atmosphere of oxygen in order that the solar center may have an
atmosphere of hydrogen; these planetary atmospheres must be supplied
with nitrogen, because nitrogen is universally available, and similar
causes operating under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span>similar circumstances will produce like
effects; these atmospheres must be charged with condensed aqueous
vapors, and, if cool enough, must have deposited water in liquid form,
for aqueous vapors when condensed by gravity are the correlated sources
of supply of their respective gaseous components at both solar and
planetary poles; and these planets must rotate in orderly periods
around their central suns, or the aqueous vapors cannot be regularly
and continuously disassociated into their elemental gases. These
planets may be few or many&mdash;perhaps even a single one
sometimes&mdash;for each sun, but they must be large enough or numerous
enough to operate by their aggregate mass, so as to disassociate around
the planets as much oxygen as their central sun disassociates of
hydrogen in their combining proportions,&mdash;that is, two volumes of
hydrogen for each one of oxygen. We will therefore find in such planets
all the potentialities of life&mdash;we can see and study these
planets, though physically invisible, as easily and as thoroughly as we
do our own, for having the relationship of constitution between our own
planets and our sun, we may thereby learn the essential relationship
between any fixed star and its planets by directly studying the
constitution of such star alone. Among the planets of our own system
Neptune and Mercury, and those which exist adjacent to their
boundaries, can be studied with difficulty and uncertainty; but what
astronomer doubts that they are constituted much like the other
planets, and have passed, or will pass, through such stages of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>progress as we find apparent among those more
directly under our observation? While we shall thus find universality
and harmony among all the starry systems, we shall not find identity;
but with the guiding light of demonstrated scientific principles, we
may apply our knowledge as a key to unlock the mysteries of the most
distant stars. The Milky Way will gleam with new meaning, Sirius,
Aldebaran, the Pleiades, will send us messages of fellowship, and the
established sphere of creative energy will have expanded, with all its
wondrous mechanism, to fill the universe. When we see at night a vast
factory building with every window lighted, one who understands the
operation and mechanism essential to the work of a mill sees not alone
the illuminated windows, but the looms in motion, the flying shuttles,
the spindles humming, the wheels turning, and all the complicated
machinery in active operation. And he can even picture operatives at
work in their various avocations, and the flashing windows, though
themselves silent, are the visible index of the light within which
illuminates and makes possible the work there performed. And so, when
thus comprehended, the flaming stars, but points of light in the
archways of the sky, themselves will reveal to us the wondrous workings
within the realm which they illuminate and warm and vivify. We may also
reasonably infer, as will be more fully explained further on, that
there can be no actual basis for the opinion sometimes expressed, that
great, dark, solid orbs&mdash;independent worlds, in fact&mdash;are
drifting about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>through space at random, as it were, like homeless
vagabonds. In these sparsely-occupied domains the head of each
household, as in every well-regulated family, has all its different
members gathered around in strict subordination, to aid in the support
of the establishment. No sun no planets; no planets no sun, is the
general statement of the sidereal formula. Like a sexual duality, the
mutually correlated parts constitute a single, composite, and
interdependent whole: one generates, concentrates, and transmits; the
other receives, transforms, and delivers.</p>
<p class="endNote"><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;Regarding the
absence of oxygen from the sun&rsquo;s atmosphere we quote the
following from Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s very recent address (see note at
end of Chapter I.): &ldquo;It is a great aggravation of the mystery
which surrounds the question of the elements, that, among the lines
which are absent from the spectrum of the sun, those of nitrogen and
oxygen stand first. Oxygen constitutes the largest portion of the solid
and liquid substances of our planet, so far as we know it; and nitrogen
is very far the predominant constituent of our atmosphere. If the earth
is a detached bit whirled off the mass of the sun, as cosmogonists love
to tell us, how comes it that in leaving the sun we cleaned him out so
completely of his nitrogen and oxygen that not a trace of these gases
remains behind to be discovered even by the sensitive vision of the
spectroscope?&rdquo; We shall find that the absence of oxygen in the
solar envelope is a necessary corollary of its presence in those of the
planets. The same is true, possibly, of nitrogen. Ammoniacal vapors are
decomposable into hydrogen and nitrogen, and hydrocarbon gases into
hydrogen and carbon, just as aqueous vapors are resolvable into
hydrogen and oxygen. In the earlier stages of the earth&rsquo;s
development we have abundant evidence of an atmosphere heavily laden
with carbonic vapors, which have disappeared, to remain stored as fixed
carbon, and the oxygen has also largely disappeared, to constitute the
enormous mass of oxides in the earth&rsquo;s mass, while the nitrogen
remains to dilute the remaining oxygen and constitute the air we
breathe. Their common correlative, hydrogen, intermingled with metallic
vapors, composes the vast atmosphere of the sun. <span class=

<p class="first">But is there such an available force? There is one,
and only one,&mdash;electricity, when properly generated and suitably
applied. It is an axiom of electrical science that any fluid which will
at all conduct a current of electricity can be decomposed by a current
of electricity. (See Urbanitsky&rsquo;s work, &ldquo;Electricity in the
Service of Man,&rdquo; Cassell&rsquo;s edition, page 154.) It is there
stated (page 152), &ldquo;We have frequently had occasion to mention
certain chemical effects of electricity,&mdash;namely, the
decomposition of gaseous compounds into simple gases.&rdquo; Page 157,
&ldquo;Whatever the substances we expose to the action of the galvanic
current, decomposition takes place proportional to the strength of the
current.&rdquo; Page 152, &ldquo;Hydrogen is always evolved at the
negative pole of the battery and oxygen at the positive pole. The gases
can then be collected in different tubes, the hydrogen tube receiving
twice as much gas as the oxygen tube; since water consists of two
volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, it follows that the
galvanic current decomposes water into its constituents. As chemically
pure water has so great a resistance as almost to force us to consider
it a non-conductor, it is generally acidulated with sulphuric acid. The
smallest amount of acid diminishes the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>resistance considerably.
The silent discharge is far more effective in bringing about this
transformation than the spark discharge.&rdquo; Page 37, &ldquo;Gases
are bad conductors of electricity; if it had been otherwise, we should
never have become acquainted with electricity, as it would have been
conducted away by the air as fast as it was generated. The vacuum also
does not conduct electricity, but <i>moist air</i> becomes a partial
conductor. Moist air also will spoil the insulation of non-conducting
supports. All bodies are more or less hygroscopic, and the moisture
condensed on their surfaces <i>thus turns the best insulators into
conductors</i>. Change of temperature also influences
conductivity.&rdquo; Page 63, &ldquo;When using induction machines, the
moisture of the air often causes experiments to fail, especially before
large audiences. The atmosphere becomes saturated with moisture, and it
is often impossible to get the machine in working order.&rdquo; Several
desiccating devices are mentioned by the authors of this work, as used
with such machines, to prevent such dissipation or conduction of
electricity from the machine into space by the aqueous vapor of the
atmosphere. In describing the aurora borealis (page 93), these authors
say, &ldquo;The rarefied air is nearer the earth at the poles than the
equator, in consequence of the earth&rsquo;s centrifugal motion, and,
the earth being negatively electrified, negative electricity will flow
from this point, directed against the <i>positively electrified upper
layers of rarefied air</i>.&rdquo; Same work, pages 127, 128,
&ldquo;The resistance (in liquids) diminishes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>as the
temperature increases, a result which is exactly opposite to what
occurs with metals. Conductivity for carbon increases with the
temperature, thus agreeing with the action of liquids.&rdquo; Page 133,
&ldquo;To determine the resistance in liquids, the above methods cannot
be employed, liquids being decomposed by the electrical current.&rdquo;
Referring to the voltaic arc and the spark of the induction apparatus
(page 200), it is said, &ldquo;Dry air under great pressure offers a
high resistance, but a <i>perfect vacuum is a perfect insulator</i>,
and between these extremes there are degrees of rarification which
admit of a flow of electricity.&rdquo; In general, it is said that
electrical decomposition requires that the electrolyte be in liquid
form, but this is not universally true, and throughout interplanetary
space may not be true at all. In Ferguson&rsquo;s work on Electricity,
it is stated that, &ldquo;The passage of electricity through compound
gases in a state of great rarity, as in the so-called vacuum tubes,
frequently separates them up into their constituents.&rdquo; So, also,
the opinion that electricity cannot be readily conducted through dry
gases is refuted by the play of the auroral streamers. The distance
from the surface of the earth of these electrical waves and the auroral
arch is variously estimated at from seventy to two hundred and
sixty-five miles, and in one instance &ldquo;at a height of from four
thousand to six thousand miles;&rdquo; see article in Appleton&rsquo;s
Cyclop&aelig;dia. Certainly there could be no sensible moisture at the
temperatures there prevalent, and especially at night and during the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>fall and winter months when these displays are
very frequent. Whether the currents be due to induction, as between
neighboring bodies one of which is electrified, or from direct
emission, as in brush discharges, there must obviously be some medium
of contact and continuity for the free transference of electrical
energy through space. Regarding the <i>rationale</i> of electrolysis
(&ldquo;Electricity in the Service of Man&rdquo;), after discussing
certain other theories, the authors say, &ldquo;Clausius, too, assumes
an electrified condition of the molecules of each electrode, but he
neither attributes to the galvanic current the force of direction nor
power of decomposing. He points out that both the molecules of fluids
and also their atoms are in continual motion. The atoms in molecules of
fluids are held together but by a moderate force, and the molecules
themselves constantly undergo changes both of synthesis and analysis.
The galvanic current merely effects a regulated motion of the atoms;
the positive ions are attracted by the negative electrode, and the
negative ions by the positive electrode, and by this means are
separated out from the liquid.&rdquo; Page 91, &ldquo;The upper layers
of air are more or less electrified, so as to have a potential
differing from that of the earth, but <i>how their electrical condition
has been produced is not at present known</i>. Condensation of
water-vapor is supposed to produce electricity. Close to the earth the
air has little or no electricity; the farther from the earth the
greater the amount of electricity in the air.&rdquo; Referring to the
sparking discharge, it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href=
"#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>said, page 75, &ldquo;The density of
the air, however, has to be taken into account; the sparking distance
is lessened in denser air, and becomes greater when the atmospheric
pressure is diminished. Not only the density, but also the chemical
composition of the medium influences the sparking distance. Faraday
found the distances considerably less in chlorine gas, but <i>twice as
long in hydrogen gas as in air</i>.&rdquo; Page 74, &ldquo;The sparking
distance increases at a somewhat greater rate than the difference of
potential of the discharging bodies&#8202;&hellip;. When the sparking
distance becomes very great &hellip; it is proportional to the
difference of potential.&rdquo; Page 91, &ldquo;There is a difference
of potential between the earth and points in the air above. In fine
weather the potential is higher the higher we go, increasing usually at
the rate of <i>twenty to forty volts for each foot</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be seen that, continued upward at this rate, the increased
electrical pressure for each mile of elevation would be between 100,000
and 200,000 volts, or for each one hundred miles more than 10,000,000
volts; and at an altitude of one thousand miles, if carried so far, the
potential would be between one and two hundred million volts, an
electrical pressure quite inconceivable to us. Such a potential in
currents of enormous quantity continually flowing from the earth to the
sun would certainly decompose any aqueous vapors condensed around these
bodies. But the question at once arises, What reason is there to
suppose that such currents could possibly flow between the earth and
the sun, across <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>that vast intervening region of space, a distance
of more than 90,000,000 miles? And would not the resistance to such
currents in transit be so enormous that the entire potential, however
great, would have been practically lost long before reaching the sun?
To this there is a complete and irrefutable answer, not based upon any
abstract theory, but upon established fact. It is an absolute certainty
that electrical currents of enormous quantity and high potential are
constantly passing between the earth and the sun, and that these
currents have so free a passage&mdash;far more free than through any
metallic circuits that we know of&mdash;that they pass over this
enormous distance absolutely without appreciable resistance. We may
note in this connection the well-known facts, now being largely
utilized, though the art is still in its infancy, of telegraphing and
transmitting all sorts of electrical currents over large distances
without wires or any conductors, except those furnished by nature.</p>
<p>Of the currents between the earth and the sun, Professor Proctor, in
his &ldquo;Light Science for Leisure Hours,&rdquo; says,
&ldquo;Remembering the influence which the sun has been found to
exercise upon the magnetic needle, the question will naturally arise,
Has the sun anything to do with magnetic storms? We have clear evidence
that he has. On the 1st of September, 1859, Messrs. Carrington and
Hodgson were observing the sun, one at Oxford and the other in London.
Their scrutiny was directed to certain large spots which at that time
marked the sun&rsquo;s face. Suddenly a bright light was seen by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>each observer to break out on the sun&rsquo;s
surface and to travel, slowly in appearance, but in reality at the rate
of about seven thousand miles in a minute, across a part of the solar
disk. Now, it was found afterwards that the self-registering magnetic
instruments at Kew had made <i>at that very instant</i> a
strongly-marked jerk. It was learned that at that moment a magnetic
storm prevailed in the West Indies, in South America, and in Australia.
The signal men in the telegraph stations at Washington and Philadelphia
received strong electric shocks; the pen of Bain&rsquo;s telegraph was
followed by a flame of fire; and in Norway the telegraphic machinery
was set on fire. At night great auroras were seen in both hemispheres.
It is impossible not to connect these startling magnetic indications
with the remarkable appearance observed upon the sun&rsquo;s disk. But
there is other evidence. Magnetic storms prevail more commonly in some
years than in others. In those years in which they occur most
frequently it is found that the ordinary oscillations of the magnetic
needle are more extensive than usual. Now, when these peculiarities had
been noticed for many years, it was found that there was an alternate
and systematic increase and diminution in intensity of magnetic action,
and that the period of the variation was about eleven years. But at the
same time a diligent observer had been recording the appearance of the
sun&rsquo;s face from day to day and from year to year. He had found
that the solar spots are in some years more freely displayed than in
others, and he had determined the period in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>which
the spots had successively presented with maximum frequency to be about
eleven years. On a comparison of the two sets of observations it was
found (and has now been placed beyond a doubt by many years of
continual observation) that magnetic perturbations are most energetic
when the sun is most spotted, and <i>vice versa</i>. For so remarkable
a phenomenon as this none but a cosmical cause can suffice. We can
neither say that the spots cause the magnetic storms nor that the
magnetic storms cause the spots. We must seek for a cause producing at
once both sets of phenomena.&rdquo; It will be observed that the
phenomena seen in the sun were marked <i>at the same instant</i> by
violent electric perturbations on earth. Hence something must have
passed with the velocity of light, which we know to be at the rate of
188,000 miles per second, or in about eight minutes from the sun to the
earth. But it is stated in &ldquo;Electricity in the Service of
Man,&rdquo; page 82, that, &ldquo;According to the theoretical
calculations of Kirchhoff, as well as of Ayrton and Perry, the velocity
of electricity in a wire <i>without resistance would be equal to the
velocity of light</i>.&rdquo; Hence we perceive that the apparent
difficulty has vanished in the light of observed fact, and that
currents of electricity do pass and are constantly passing between the
earth and the sun without the slightest loss of speed,&mdash;that is to
say, without resistance. We shall find in the sequel that the above
phenomena were caused most probably by a partial interruption of a
constant direct current from the earth to the sun, instead of by an
opposite return <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>current from the sun to the earth. In further
illustration of the above facts we quote the following, page 172,
&ldquo;Electricity in the Service of Man:&rdquo; &ldquo;Many attempts
have been made to find a connection between the spots and prominences
in the sun and the electrical phenomena on the earth. Professor Forster
says that by numerous magnetic observations of the last thirty or forty
years it has been proved that the formation of black spots on the
surface of the sun, and the generation of pillars and clouds of glowing
gases in the immediate neighborhood of the sun, stand in close
connection with certain deviations in direction and intensity of the
earth&rsquo;s magnetic forces.&rdquo; Professor Proctor, in his
&ldquo;Light Science for Leisure Hours,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;From all
this it appears, incontestably, that there is an intimate connection
between the causes of auroras and those of terrestrial
magnetism&#8202;&hellip;. The magnetic needle not only swayed
responsively to auroras observable in the immediate neighborhood, but
to auroras in progress hundreds and thousands of miles away. Nay, as
inquiry progressed, it was discovered that the needles in our northern
observatories are swayed by influences associated even with the
occurrence of auroras around the southern polar regions&#8202;&hellip;.
Could we only associate auroras with terrestrial magnetism, we should
still have done much to enhance the interest which the beautiful
phenomenon is calculated to excite. But when once this association has
been established, others of even greater interest are brought into
recognition; for terrestrial magnetism has been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>clearly
shown to be influenced directly by the action of the
sun&#8202;&hellip;. We already begin to see, then, that auroras are
associated in some mysterious way with the action of the solar rays.
The phenomenon which had been looked on for so many ages as a mere
spectacle, caused perhaps by some process in the upper regions of the
air of a simple local character, has been brought into the range of
planetary phenomena. As surely as the brilliant planets which deck the
nocturnal skies are illuminated by the same orb which gives us our days
and seasons, so are they subject to the same mysterious influence which
causes the northern banners to wave respondently over the starlit
depths of heaven. Nay, it is even probable that every flicker and
coruscation of our auroral displays correspond with similar
manifestations upon every planet which travels round the sun.&rdquo; In
Professor Ball&rsquo;s late work, &ldquo;In the High Heavens,&rdquo;
the author says, &ldquo;Dr. Schuster suggests that there may be an
electric connection between the sun and the planets. In fact, with some
limitations, we might even assert that there <i>must</i> be such a
connection. It is well known that great outbreaks on the sun have been
immediately followed, I might almost say accompanied, by remarkable
magnetic disturbances on the earth. The instances that are recorded of
this connection are altogether too remarkable to be set aside as mere
coincidences. Dr. Huggins has not referred in this connection to
Hertz&rsquo;s astonishing discoveries; but it seems quite possible that
research along this line may throw light on the subject, <i>at present
so obscure</i>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>of the electric relation between the sun and the
earth.&rdquo; Of this common electrical relationship between our sun
and the different planets, and of these with each other, Professor
Proctor says, in his article, &ldquo;Terrestrial Magnetism,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Interesting as are the bonds of union which Copernicus and
Kepler and Newton have traced in the relations of our system, <i>it
would seem as though we were approaching the traces of a yet more
wonderful law of association</i>. We see the earth&rsquo;s magnetism
responding to the solar influences, not merely in those rhythmic
motions which belong to the periodic variations, but in sudden thrills
affecting the whole framework of our globe. The magnetic storms which
are called into action by such solar disturbances as the one of
September, 1859, are, we may feel sure, not peculiar to our own earth.
The other planets feel the same influence,&mdash;not, perhaps, in
exactly the same way, but according to the constitution and physical
habitudes which respectively belong to them. So that one can scarce
conceive a subject of study at once more promising and more
interesting.&rdquo; Of these prophetic shadows which science often
seems to cast before, Professor Nichol, in his &ldquo;Architecture of
the Heavens&rdquo; (referring to Sir William Herschel), says,
&ldquo;Without difficulty or pretence he there casts aside an idea
which had not been questioned before, unless in a few of those obscure,
indefinite speculations <i>which, strangely enough, often prelude
important discoveries</i>.&rdquo; These facts are thus incontestably
established: that electric currents of enormous energy and vast
quantity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>are constantly passing without appreciable
resistance and with the speed of light between the earth and the sun;
that such currents cannot be conducted through vacua, or through dry
gases, or through a dense medium; and that, whatever other matter may
exist in the intervening space, such space is pervaded throughout by an
attenuated vapor of such constitution and density that it will transmit
such electrical currents with the highest conceivable efficiency. We
know that such passage of these currents cannot depend upon the ether
of space which is acted upon by the sun to produce the ethereal
undulatory vibrations of light and heat, for, after we have produced
the most perfect vacuum possible, we find that the rays of light
continue to pass through it as freely as they pass through space, while
currents of electricity cannot be made to pass at all. Hence we know to
a certainty that the medium which transmits these enormous currents of
electricity must be a vapor capable of conducting electricity, that it
must hence be decomposable by the electric current, and that when
decomposed one of its elements must consist of hydrogen gas and the
other of oxygen; in other words, that this conducting medium must
consist of attenuated <i>aqueous</i> vapor, commingled doubtless with
other vapors which themselves, like the acid of the acidulated water
used in electrolysis, aid in the conduction of these enormous currents.
We also know that such vapors in space will be necessarily attracted,
by gravitation, around the solar and planetary bodies immersed therein,
and must form <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>condensed vaporous atmospheres or cloud masses,
and if these are decomposed by the passage of such currents of
electricity, that hydrogen gas will be liberated at the solar galvanic
pole and oxygen at the terrestrial or other planetary pole, precisely
as we find to be the case in nature. Will such gaseous envelopes, then,
have the same temperature for each gas when thus liberated, or will the
hydrogen envelope of the sun be heated to incandescence, due to the
passage of the electrical current?</p>

<p>The temperature of interplanetary space is probably very low. Of
this Professor Ball says, &ldquo;What this may be is a matter of some
uncertainty, but from all the evidence available it seems plain that we
may put it at not less than three hundred degrees below zero;&rdquo;
and the same author adds, &ldquo;The temperature is taken to be
sixty-four degrees below zero, being presumably that at the confines of
the atmosphere.&rdquo; Whatever the temperature of space, or its
variations, may be, the passage of the planetary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>electricity through the condensed hydrogen
envelope of the sun will produce great changes in the heat of that body
and of the solar core within. While with a small electrolytic apparatus
we find no special differences of temperature in the gases, with large
quantities of electricity, driven at a high potential, we find that a
new and startling result ensues. Something of this sort is seen in the
operation of electric arc-light lamps, now in common use, in which two
slightly separated carbon points are traversed by a current of
considerable potential. The current is driven across the intervening
space between the points, carrying with it an atmosphere of
disintegrated carbon, through which the electricity is carried at its
highest speed, and a most brilliant light is produced. In
&ldquo;Electricity in the Service of Man,&rdquo; page 151, it is said,
&ldquo;We may conclude from this that the current does not cease when
the arc of light is formed. The resistance of the arc seems to be only
very slight; in fact, the current must be conducted by it.&rdquo; Of
the structure and constitution of the luminous electrosphere, or arc,
produced in these lamps, &ldquo;Professor J. A. Fleming,&rdquo; says
the <i>Scientific American</i>, &ldquo;has shown that the well-known
color of the light of the electric arc from carbon points is due to the
incandescence of the carbon filling the space between the positive and
the negative rods. The true arc is here, and exists in a space filled
with the <i>vapor of carbon</i>, which has a brilliant violet color.
Examined by the spectroscope, the central axis of the carbon arc gives
a spectrum marked by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84"
name="pb84">84</a>]</span>two bright violet bands. Outside this is an
aureole of carbon vapor of yellow or golden color. The electrical
strain of the arc occurs chiefly <i>at the surface of the crater</i>
which forms at the end of the positive rod, where, in fact, the
principal work of generating light is done; for <i>eighty per cent. of
the total light of the arc comes from the incandescent carbon at this
place</i>. Thus, in a sense, the arc light is mainly an incandescent
light, the effect being produced by the layer of carbon which is being
constantly evaporated at an extremely elevated temperature. Hence the
light of the carbon arc is not, and can never be, white, as it is
sometimes described as being, but must always be tinted violet by the
carbon vapor normally present between the rods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The significance of the above-quoted extract will be readily
perceived when we come to consider the action of the direct planetary
electrical currents upon the solar envelope, the effects in both cases
being substantially identical. The quantity and intensity of the
electric current, as it passes through the incandescent arc to the
negative pole, and thence back to the dynamo, are diminished exactly in
proportion to the energy expended in the generation of the light and
heat of the arc. It is precisely the same as in the operation of a
turbine water-wheel; if working at its highest efficiency, the
discharged water is almost deprived of force: its gravity has been
converted into work. In the electric light this conversion is only
partial, owing to atmospheric and other conditions; but in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>case of the solar envelope and its core, it is
nearly, if not altogether, perfect, so that the currents of electricity
are almost entirely converted into light and heat, or expended in the
electrolytic decomposition of the surrounding aqueous vapors, and do
not reappear as electricity, but as converted solar energy. Brilliant,
however, as the light rays are in a powerful arc lamp,&mdash;perhaps
the nearest to solar light we can produce,&mdash;the obscure heat rays
are far more numerous and powerful. On page 476 of the work just cited
a table is given, showing the proportion of visible and invisible rays
emitted by different illuminants, and with the electric lamp, even,
ninety per cent. of all the rays emitted by the voltaic arc are heat
rays, which are obscure and invisible. But the startling effects of
electricity of large quantity and high potential, in the decomposition
of water, are far more strikingly exhibited by an apparatus shown in
1893 at the Chicago Exhibition by a firm from Brussels, and which is
described in the <i>Electrical Review</i> as follows: &ldquo;An
ordinary wooden pail is three-quarters filled with water slightly
acidulated; a lead plate about nine inches broad by sixteen inches long
dips to the bottom of the pail and is connected to an incandescent
dynamo machine capable of giving over one hundred and fifty
amp&egrave;res. The iron rod, or article to be heated, is connected to
the pole of the dynamo and simply dipped into the water; it immediately
becomes heated and rapidly rises to a melting temperature; only that
portion of the metal completely immersed becomes heated, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>and the
heating is so rapid that neither the water nor that portion of the
metal out of the water becomes very warm. Wrought iron and steel
actually melt if long enough held under water. A carbon rod subjected
to this process becomes amorphous carbon, proving that a temperature of
at least four thousand degrees Centigrade has been reached, and it is
stated that with two hundred and twenty volts&rsquo; pressure a
temperature of eight thousand degrees Centigrade has been reached.
There are various theories to account for this phenomenon, but from
close observation it appears to be a case of arc heating. The moment
the metal is plunged into the water <i>it is enveloped in hydrogen
gas</i> decomposed from the water. This envelope of gas parts the water
and metal, forming an arc, which raises the surrounding gaseous
envelope to an enormous temperature; the metal surrounded by this arc
is almost immediately raised to the same temperature. <i>A flame of
burning hydrogen</i> appears around the metal on the surface of the
water. The principle of the method is the same as that on which the
burning of an arc light between two carbon points under water depends.
An arc lamp will burn quite steadily under water if the connections are
made water-proof; the arc itself requires no protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be seen that the process above described is precisely
analogous to that involved in the problem of the sun&rsquo;s energy.
The planets correspond with the leaden plates, upon which oxygen is
disengaged from the water, while at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>same moment the liberated
hydrogen necessarily appears at the opposite pole. The generation of
hydrogen gas forms an envelope or atmosphere of hydrogen around the sun
which forces back the aqueous vapor. The current, in passing through
this gaseous envelope to the metal core within, intensely heats the
hydrogen, which rapidly communicates its rising heat to the central
core. If this core is composed of metals, and the temperature be raised
sufficiently high, which only depends upon the quantity and working
pressure of the electricity employed, the metal core will be
volatilized in whole or in part, and, if of mixed metals, we will find
the presence of these elements revealed in the spectroscopic lines
corresponding thereto, and the flames and flashes of hydrogen at the
surfaces beyond the envelope, at the surface of contact with the matter
of space, will be also seen. In fact, such an experiment, properly
prepared, could be made to show roughly most of the phenomena of solar
light and heat as they actually appear, such as sun-spots, prominences,
jets, plumes, facul&aelig;, the photosphere, chromosphere, absorption
bands, vortical disturbances, metallic vapors, and the complete solar
spectrum, with the different Fraunhofer lines. In the case of the sun,
these currents must be measured by millions of amp&egrave;res, and
possibly by hundreds of millions of volts, instead of by mere hundreds,
while the hydrogen envelope extends outward from the sun&rsquo;s
surface hundreds of thousands of miles until, perhaps, finally merged
into the corona. As the currents <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88"
href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>pass from the planets and
planetoids (for not only the larger planets, but all the planetary
bodies of our system must contribute, if any of them contribute) to the
sun, or rather to the sphere of its electrical action, without
resistance, so long as these planets generate constant currents of the
same, or nearly the same, potential, so long will the sun maintain his
constant light and heat; if these are increased or diminished, the
sun&rsquo;s light and heat will be temporarily, but only temporarily,
increased or diminished; and this process must continue, without
further loss or change, indefinitely into the future. Whatever the sun
may gain by increment of meteoric masses may pass for what it is worth,
but the gradual contraction of his volume cannot proceed while his
present temperature is maintained by the passage of such
currents,&mdash;that is to say, his light and heat will remain
constant, and also his mass and volume, so long as the electric
currents which pass from the planets to the sun and the constitution of
space which surrounds the sun and planets themselves remain
constant.</p>

</div>
<p>It now remains to consider how such enormous currents of electricity
can be generated and maintained. We know, of course, that chemical
changes cannot operate to produce them. They must be derived from
something contained in or diffused through interplanetary space, and
the planets themselves must be the means by which such currents of
electricity are brought into effective operation. On our own earth we
have many kinds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>of mechanically-constructed electrical apparatus
which <i>generate</i> electricity, to use a popular expression, or
which, more properly, separate the opposite potentials from an unstable
electrical tension or equilibrium of the matter of space. These
machines practically take positive electricity from the
mutually-balanced electric potentials of which the earth and its
surrounding gaseous envelope are the vast common storehouse, in such
manner that the positive electricity thus drawn out from and again
passing into the common storehouse shall, during such transit, be
compelled to pass through channels which will cause it to do work, at
the expense of its potential or pressure, during its passage, or in
which electricity is raised in its electro-motive force from a lower to
a higher potential or pressure, just as the pressure of water is
increased when delivered from a greater or a still greater height, or
steam, when confined in space under higher and still higher
temperatures. But none of these machines actually <i>generate</i>
electricity <i>ab initio</i>; they merely put into effective operation
the pre-existing force. The mass of the earth is of irregularly
negative polarity, the air above is positive, and as we <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>ascend,
the potential, or voltage, or pressure increases at a nearly uniform
rate of from twenty to forty volts for each foot. The earth is thus
surrounded by an electrosphere as well as an atmosphere, and the two
are not coincident, for while the pressure of the atmosphere diminishes
as we ascend, that of the electrosphere increases. The moon, too, and
each planet must have its electrosphere, and around the sun&rsquo;s
core we can see the solar electrosphere in its visible glory. Thus, all
our planets rotate upon their axes and revolve around the sun, each
surrounded by an enormous electrosphere, just as an electrical
induction machine is surrounded, when in operation, with an
electrosphere of its own, and which, by breaking connection with the
conductor which carries away its current, becomes, when shown in a
darkened room, clearly visible. In &ldquo;Electricity in the Service of
Man&rdquo; it is said, page 63, &ldquo;The inductive action of the
machine is quite as rapid and as powerful when both collectors are
removed and nothing is left but the two rotating disks and their
respective contact or neutralizing brushes. The whole apparatus then
bristles with electricity, and if viewed in the dark presents a most
beautiful appearance, being literally bathed with luminous brush
discharges.&rdquo; This is a true aurora.</p>

<p>Let us now examine some of these more recent electric
machines,&mdash;the later induction, not the older frictional machines,
for it is obvious that the rotation of the planets, if they operate as
electric generators, or separators, must act by induction <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>and not
by friction. The frictional machines are of the old type and are well
known from the books; in these a glass disk or cylinder is rubbed upon
in its rotation by an amalgamated (so called) friction pad fixed
securely to the bed of the machine. But more recently these have been
replaced by far more powerful and simple machines which operate
entirely by induction, like approaching thunderclouds, for instance,
and in which one or more glass disks are merely rotated rapidly and
freely in the air, these disks having a number of light metallic
sectors, such as bits of tin-foil, pasted on their outer sides at equal
radial intervals, and with metallic collecting brushes which, however,
barely graze the surfaces of the rotating disk. There is no pressure
and no friction, except that of the disks as they freely revolve in the
atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the above-quoted work, page 61, is a description of
Wimshurst&rsquo;s influence machine, one of the most recent and most
powerful, which we condense as follows: This machine was produced about
1883. It consists of two circular disks of thin glass fourteen and
one-half inches in diameter in the sample described, attached at their
centers to loose bosses, so as to be rotated by cords and pulleys
operated by a handle, in opposite directions. The disks rotate parallel
with each other and are not more than one-eighth of an inch apart, and
have their surfaces well varnished; and attached by cement to their
outer surfaces are twelve or more radial, sector-shaped plates of thin
brass- or tin-foil, disposed around the disks at equal distances apart.
These <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>sectors take the place of the
&ldquo;inductors&rdquo; of Holtz&rsquo;s instrument, and appear to act
also as carriers, though the exact nature of their action is somewhat
mysterious. It appears, however, probable that those acting for the
time as carriers on the one disk act at the same time as inductors on
the other. The two sectors on the same diameter of each disk, at
opposite sides of the center, are twice in each revolution momentarily
placed in metallic connection with one another by means of a pair of
fine wire brushes attached to the ends of a bent metal rod loosely
pivoted at the center of each disk, the metal sectors <i>just
grazing</i> the tips of the wire brushes as they pass. There is one of
these bent rods on the outside of each disk, and their position as
pivoted on their center can be varied at will, both with reference to
the one on the opposite side and to the position of the fixed
collecting combs. The efficiency of the machine varies with their
position, and the maximum appears to be generally when the brushes
touch the disks on diameters crossing the position of the collecting
combs at about forty-five degrees, and with the bent rods on opposite
sides at right angles to each other. The collecting combs are simple
forks with collecting points turned inward, which forks embrace the
opposite sides of the disks outside, which freely rotate between them,
and they are supported on insulated posts. These supports may be small
Leyden jars or condensers, with discharging knobs, or may be connected
with similar condensers at a distance, or arranged in batteries or
otherwise. The presence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>of the collecting combs is not
necessary to the operation of the machine, their sole function being to
carry away the positive electricity as generated. The machine is
self-exciting, and it is believed that the <i>initial action</i> must
be due to friction in the layer of air contained between the plates,
which, as above stated, are only about one-eighth of an inch apart. It
is nearly independent of atmospheric conditions, and not liable to
reverse its polarity, as are the Voss machines. The Voss machine uses a
larger glass disk which does not rotate, but is fixed, and which has a
central opening three inches wide, with a different arrangement of
tin-foil disks or sectors, and a smaller glass disk rotates parallel
with it. The Holtz machine is somewhat similar, using a single
rotating, well-varnished glass disk revolving opposite a well-varnished
larger disk, the latter provided with three sector-shaped openings or
windows, with varnished paper inductors or flaps passing through these
windows so as to touch the revolving disk. There are also two series of
fine metal points held by brass bars provided with insulated handles
and discharging knobs.</p>
<p>It is only necessary to give a general idea of the construction and
operation of such machines, as their specific construction can be
readily learned from the books. Of the mode of operation, however, it
is said, &ldquo;What takes place when the machine is in action is of a
very complicated nature, and can hardly be said to be perfectly
understood.&rdquo; With a Wimshurst machine having disks of a diameter
of fourteen and one-half inches &ldquo;there is produced <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>under
ordinary atmospheric conditions a powerful spark discharge between the
knobs when they are separated by a distance of four and one-half
inches, a pint size Leyden jar being in connection with each knob (one
on each opposite diameter of the two disks), and these
four-and-one-half-inch discharges take place in regular succession at
every two and a half turns of the handle. It is usual to construct the
machine with small Leyden jars or condensers attached to conductors, by
which the spark is materially increased. A machine has been constructed
with plates seven feet in diameter, which, it was believed, would give
sparks thirty inches long; but no Leyden jars have been found to
withstand its discharge, all being pierced by the enormous
tension.&rdquo; Three of Toepler&rsquo;s induction machines (see page
59, &ldquo;Electricity in the Service of Man&rdquo;), connected
together, gave a current which maintained a platinum wire one-fifth of
a millimeter thick continually at a red heat, and was also capable of
decomposing water. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96"

<p class="first">The remarkable resemblance between the mode of
operation and effects of these electrical induction machines and the
vast rotating electrosphere of the earth must be at once apparent. The
operation is precisely the same, and the results must, <i>pari
passu</i>, be substantially similar. We need not seek for precise
parallelism of structure, because these machines themselves, it has
been shown, widely differ in structure among themselves. But the almost
infinitely more vast terrestrial electrosphere, which cannot be less
than ten thousand miles in diameter, and perhaps much more (if we may
form an opinion from the relative magnitude of the field of action of
the hydrogen envelope which constitutes the solar electrosphere),
rotating in the attenuated vapors of space, among which vapors that of
water plays a most important part, and which vapors constantly impinge
with various disturbances of contact against the more and more
attenuated layers of the terrestrial atmosphere, and which gradually,
from within outward, less and less partakes of the earth&rsquo;s
rotation until, finally, its rotatory movement is lost in the vast
ocean of space, establishes the certainty that enormous quantities of
electricity must there be disengaged, precisely <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>as in
the machines which we have described, and to learn the potential or
active pressure of this electricity we have only to consider the fact
that we find a rise so rapid, as we ascend through our atmosphere, that
the potential increases by from twenty to forty volts for each foot.
That these currents are transmitted to the sun without appreciable
resistance we already know, and that they are there transformed into
light and heat we can, from the previously cited experiments, see.</p>
<p>But it may be urged that the resistance of such attenuated vapors in
space, and the generation of electricity in such quantities, would
inevitably retard and finally destroy planetary motion. The sufficient
answer to this is found in the consideration that the same facts must
exist under any possible mode of organization of our solar system, and
that such interference, besides, must have absolutely prevented its
formation at all, if such were the case. All the matter of our
planetary system together is only one seven-hundred-and-fiftieth that
of the sun; if this were added to the sun&rsquo;s bulk it would but
slightly enlarge it. But all this solar and planetary matter together,
if distributed over the space occupied by our planetary
system,&mdash;and, by the nebular hypothesis of the organization of our
solar system, this is requisite,&mdash;and having an axial diameter
one-half that of its equatorial (see Proctor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Familiar
Essays on Scientific Subjects,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oxygen in the
Sun&rdquo;), would have had a density of only about one
four-hundred-thousandth that of hydrogen gas at atmospheric pressure.
This nebular mass must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98"
name="pb98">98</a>]</span>have had a diameter at least sixty times that
of the distance of the earth from the sun and a depth of thirty times
its distance. That this enormous mass of attenuated matter should ever
have been made to rotate as a whole by any force of attraction,
repulsion, or rotation, with a tenuity so great that, if measured by an
equal volume of hydrogen gas,&mdash;the lightest substance known to
us,&mdash;it would have furnished material for four hundred thousand
such systems as ours, presupposes a resistance so slight that the
planets themselves, when coagulated out of such a mass, could never in
any conceivable time exhibit retardation from such a source; and we
know to a certainty that such attenuated vapors do exist in space, for
electricity cannot be transmitted through a vacuum, and it is
transmitted with perfect freedom between the earth and the sun. But it
may be said that the laws were then different. If they were different
then, they are doubtless different now. If, on the other hand, we
assume that the bodies of which our solar system is composed were
simply aggregated into concrete masses from meteoric dust, the
difficulty is not lessened; for if the resistances to their operation
now are such as to perceptibly retard their motions, they must have
operated still more powerfully to originally prevent them; while, if
hurled forth by an almighty fiat, complete from the hand of creative
energy, the same force which impelled them forward must have also
established the laws under which they now move.</p>
<p>It is calculated that our earth must be losing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>time, by
tidal retardation, at the rate of one-half the moon&rsquo;s diameter in
each twelve hundred years (see Proctor, &ldquo;Light Science for
Leisure Hours,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Our Chief Timepiece Losing
Time&rdquo;), and that &ldquo;the length of a day is now more by about
one eighty-fourth part of a second than it was two thousand years
ago.&rdquo; Perhaps, however, we may discover that these changes are
themselves periodic and increase in cycles to a maximum, and then
diminish, as is the case with magnetic, planetary, and stellar
variations, and other similar changes, when sufficiently long observed;
for while such changes may very well accompany a theory under which our
system and all other systems are slowly running down to decay and
death, it is entirely incompatible with the primal forces under which
they <i>must</i> have been originally formed. In other words, if the
tides are dragging back our earth without compensation, this dragging
back can only come from the oceanic deposit of water on the earth from
the aqueous vapors of space which do not partake of the planetary
rotation and orbital movement of the earth. But if these can now retard
the earth&rsquo;s motion, they must have originally prevented it in the
beginning. This loss of time is, moreover, merely inferential from
mathematical computations, and its basis is found in the belief that
all the operations of nature are in a slow process of degradation, and
the calculated loss itself may be merely theoretical, and not true in
fact. Professor Proctor himself concedes the uncertainty of this
alleged retardation when he says in the same <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>article, &ldquo;At this rate of change our day
would merge into a lunar month in the course of thirty-six thousand
millions of years. But after a while the change will take place more
slowly, and <i>some trillion or so of years</i> will elapse before the
full change is effected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the processes of nature are generally believed to be running
down, everything is bent to that belief; but the forces of nature must,
nevertheless, be uniform and supreme, for it is by these forces that
the expected results are to be achieved. That changes occur constantly
is inevitable, but the source of these must be looked for in the
interaction of original forces, and not in the degradation of systems.
There is reason to believe, in fact, that the repulsion of the
terrestrial electrosphere by that of the moon may itself be sufficient
to counteract such retarding force of lunar gravity, for the tides upon
earth are not merely oceanic, but atmospheric, and on the latter the
electrical repulsion of the moon must act very powerfully and with
directly counteractive effect.</p>

</div>
<p>Let us now apply the preceding principles to the problem under
review. All planetary space is pervaded with attenuated vapors or
gases, among which aqueous vapor occupies a leading place. The planets
and all planetary bodies, having opposite electrical polarity from the
central and relatively fixed sun, by their orbital motions around and
constant subjection thereto act as enormous induction machines, which
generate electricity from the ocean of attenuated aqueous vapor, each
planet being surrounded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>by an enormous electrosphere,
carried with the planet in its axial and orbital movements, the
successive atmospheric envelopes gradually diminishing in rotational
velocity until merged into the outer ocean of space. As the planets
advance in their orbits they plunge into new and fresh fields, and, as
the whole solar system gradually moves <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>onward through space,
these fields are never re-occupied. These electrospheres, by their
rotation, generate enormous quantities of electricity at an extremely
high potential,&mdash;so high that we can scarcely even conceive
it,&mdash;and this electricity flows in a constant current to the sun,
where it disappears as electricity, to reappear in the form of solar
light and heat. These planetary currents also flow towards such other
negatively electrified bodies as may exist in space&mdash;the comets
and fixed stars, for example&mdash;in proportion to their distance;
for, since resistance is not appreciable between ourselves and the sun,
as is also the case with light, so, like light, our electricity must
pass outward as well as inward to take part in the harmonious
operations of the whole universe. But it should be noted that the
distribution of electric energy in the form of currents is quite
different from that of light or other radiant energy; for while light
is diffused from a center outward through space, electric currents, on
the contrary, are concentrated and directed along lines of force to
concrete centers of opposite polarity. As a consequence, the intensity
of light decreases according to the squares of the distances traversed
plus the resistance to the passage of the light itself, while the
electric current is only diminished by the resistance of the medium
through which it passes. As the light of the sun has a velocity of one
hundred and eighty-eight thousand miles per second, and the electric
current between the earth and the sun the same, it will be seen that
the resistance is practically alike for these two forms <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>of
energy. Indeed, the striking resemblance between the ethereal
vibrations which constitute light and heat and exceedingly rapid
alternating currents of electricity through molecular media may suggest
that the transformation of one force into the other is some sort of a
&ldquo;step-up&rdquo; or &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; process, much higher
in degree, but of the same character as the well-known analogous
electrical transformations used in the arts. It should also be borne in
mind that, while the <i>intensity</i> of light diminishes according to
the above law, the <i>quantity</i> remains the same, less resistance,
as the area covered increases precisely in the same proportion as the
intensity diminishes,&mdash;that is, in the ratio of squares.</p>

</div>
<p>Around the earth and other planets gravity attracts the aqueous
vapors in increased density, the same as around the sun; but the
electric currents passing between the planets and the sun decompose
this aqueous vapor into its constituent gases, hydrogen and oxygen. The
oxygen is deposited within the positive electrospheres of the planetary
bodies, where it mingles with nitrogen to form our atmosphere
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>and those of the other planets. In this float
the aqueous vapors condensed from space, which are lighter than air.
(See Tyndall, &ldquo;The Forms of Water:&rdquo; &ldquo;It also sends up
a quantity of aqueous vapor which, being far lighter than air, helps
the latter to rise.&rdquo;) These aqueous vapors, condensed into clouds
and precipitated upon the earth, form our oceans and their affluents.
The hydrogen gas disengaged upon the sun&rsquo;s surface forms a
similar envelope, which is penetrated by the planetary electric
currents, and is thus highly heated and rendered incandescent; the
glowing hydrogen transmits its heat to the sun&rsquo;s mass within,
which is thus raised to, and permanently maintained in, a liquid or
densely gaseous state, its metallic constituents being volatilized in
part, and these metallic vapors mingle with the lower strata of
hydrogen to form the sun&rsquo;s photosphere, while, above, the glowing
hydrogen grows more pure, and finally, at a distance of hundreds of
thousands of miles, is merged into the corona, which is composed, in
part at least, of cosmical dust rotating around and repelled by the
sun, and which shines partly by reflected light, partly by that of the
relatively cooler hydrogen, and partly, perhaps, by electrification of
its constituents by the powerful currents passing through it. Each of
the planetary bodies, large or small, takes its proportionate part in
the generation and transmission of electricity, according to its
volume, mass, and motion. As an adjunct to this electrical sequence we
have learned that any interruption of such currents between the
generator <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>and the receiver will cause the generating
apparatus to glow with diffused electrical light, as is the case with
the Wimshurst machine already described. When such connection is
removed, it is said, &ldquo;the whole apparatus bristles with
electricity, and if viewed in the dark presents a most beautiful
appearance, being literally bathed with luminous <i>brush</i>
discharges.&rdquo; Such a phenomenon recalls at once the aurora
borealis; and when we find this as a sequence of the electrical storm
of the first of September, 1859, before described (&ldquo;at night
great auroras were seen in both hemispheres&rdquo;), and connect with
this the persistence of electricity upon insulated surfaces (see
&ldquo;Electricity in the Service of Man,&rdquo; page 53: &ldquo;Glass
being a bad conductor, the electricity does not spread all over the
plate, but remains where it is produced&rdquo;), we shall inevitably
conclude that there was some partial interruption in the current
flowing from the earth to the sun at that moment; and if we recall that
at that very instant &ldquo;suddenly a bright light was seen by each
observer to break out on the sun&rsquo;s surface and to travel across a
part of the solar disk,&rdquo; we shall learn that the processes
connected with the production of such a bright light will interrupt in
part the terrestrial current. We can readily understand that if this
bright light exceeded in electrical intensity that due to the
earth&rsquo;s current, it might temporarily reverse the polarity of the
afferent current or retard its flow, like the so-called
&ldquo;backwater&rdquo; of a mill. It would be like attempting to
discharge steam at sixty pounds&rsquo; pressure into a vessel filled
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>other steam at sixty-one pounds. Whence, then,
came this bright light? Perhaps from the conjoint action of some other
planet, perhaps from sudden chemical disassociation beneath the
surface, perhaps by the abnormal piling up of depths of transparent
glowing hydrogen or other local disturbance.</p>

minimum intensity of same.</p>
</div>
<p>And this leads to the consideration of the uniformity of solar
action. The planetary electrospheres will be constant in their
operation if the constitution of surrounding space remains uniform; but
we shall find reason to believe that there are currents in the ocean of
space, as there are currents in our own seas, and electrical generation
will necessarily vary when such currents are encountered. The sun
itself in such case, however, will become an automatic regulator, for
his density being but one-fourth that of the earth, and the
spectroscope having shown his chemical composition to a large extent,
we know that his mass must be either liquid or vaporous, and perhaps in
part both. Such masses readily respond to variations of temperature,
expanding as it rises and contracting as it falls. Hence, if a portion
of space were reached where the action of the planetary electrospheres
was increased by relative increase of temperature in some interstellar
&ldquo;Gulf Stream,&rdquo; the sun&rsquo;s volume would expand and
compensation be at once established, while, conversely, with diminution
of such planetary action, the solar volume would contract and an
increased supply from his reserve store be given out thereby. In this
way the condensation relied upon to give us heat for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>seven or seventeen million years becomes a
compensating mechanism, self-operative through the most distant cycles
of time. We shall also find in such electric currents an explanation of
sun-spots. It is not meant that a full knowledge can be obtained of
their minute constitution, nor is it necessary; but the equatorial belt
of six degrees, nearly free from sun-spots, we can readily understand
to be caused&mdash;since sun-spots are depressions in the photosphere
down to the deeper and denser cloud strata beneath&mdash;by the
equatorial piling up of the sun&rsquo;s atmosphere by its rotation. Any
point on the sun&rsquo;s equator travels at four times the rotational
velocity of one on the earth&rsquo;s equator, but the sun&rsquo;s
attraction of gravity is twenty-seven and one-tenth times that of the
earth, so that the piling up of an atmosphere of hydrogen would be
considerable, and such depressions would not ordinarily exist there.
Similarly, near the sun&rsquo;s poles we should find a gradual
darkening, as is the case; but from five degrees to thirty degrees
latitude, the sun, in its rotation, by reason of the inclination of its
axis, passes at every point directly beneath the planets, or within
their area of control, and here we find the solar spots in their
greatest number, size, and intensity. These sun-spots cross the face of
the sun in about fifteen days, and vary in development from year to
year, having a cycle of 11.11 years from maximum to maximum. They also
have a long cycle of about fifty-six years. (See article &ldquo;The
Sun,&rdquo; in Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia.) &ldquo;Wolf, in
1859, presented a formula by which the frequency of spots <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>is
connected with the motions of the four bodies, Venus, the earth,
Jupiter, and Saturn. Professor Loomis, of Yale College, has since
advocated a theory (suggested by the present writer [Proctor] in 1865,
in &lsquo;Saturn and his System,&rsquo; page 168, note) that the long
cycle of fifty-six years is related to the successive conjunctions of
Saturn and Jupiter. But the association is as yet very far from being
demonstrated, to say the least.&rdquo; Should such fact be established,
an explanation for it will be found in the direct impact of the
condensed electric currents from several planets approaching
conjunction, and raising a portion of the sun&rsquo;s atmosphere
suddenly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>to a higher temperature and volatilizing an
abnormal proportion of the semi-vaporous metallic core beneath. This
would form an upburst piling the intensely heated facul&aelig; up on
the sides and revealing the relatively darker masses of cloud beneath,
the cooler supernatant hydrogen pouring in from the upper layers to
fill the returning void. This is precisely what is seen in such spots
and their surrounding disturbances. In the article &ldquo;The
Sun,&rdquo; above quoted, we read, &ldquo;Mr. Huggins has found that
several of the absorption bands belonging to the solar spectrum are
wider in the spectrum of a spot, a circumstance indicative of increased
absorption so far as the vapors corresponding to such lines are
concerned&#8202;&hellip;. Near the great spots or groups of spots there
are often seen streaks more luminous than the neighboring surface,
called <i>facul&aelig;</i>. They are oftenest seen towards the borders
of the disk.&rdquo; This writer also describes &ldquo;luminous bridges
across spots which sink into the vortex and are replaced by others of
the numberless cloud-like forms from one hundred to one thousand miles
in diameter, the brilliancy of which so greatly exceeds that of the
intervening spaces that they must be recognized as the principal
radiators of the solar light and heat.&rdquo; The apparent retardation
of the spots most distant from the sun&rsquo;s equator may also be
partially, at least, explained by planetary currents of electricity, as
the equatorial atmosphere is deeper and more likely to carry forward
such vortices when formed, while the planets act more directly on the
sun&rsquo;s mass beneath their direct influence. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us consider this retardation of sun-spots somewhat more in
detail. Take, for example, the case of a large planet at such orbital
position that its direct line of electrical impact will penetrate the
photosphere at (say) seven degrees north solar latitude, which is about
fifty-two thousand miles from his equator. During its annual revolution
this planet will traverse, with its line of energy, every point of the
sun&rsquo;s surface down to seven degrees south latitude and back again
to its initial point, thus tracing a close spiral around the sun for
fourteen degrees, or about one hundred and four thousand miles in
width. The centrifugal force of the solar rotation piles up the
photosphere and the chromosphere around the sun&rsquo;s equator,
precisely as our atmosphere is piled up around our own equator. If the
planet be a large one (for distance has but little to do with these
electrical currents at planetary distances, in which they differ
entirely from light, heat, and gravity), or if there be two planets
nearly in conjunction, the body of the chromosphere and the surface of
the photosphere will gradually become highly heated, for currents of
electricity, of themselves, do not directly heat the solar core any
more than a like current heats the under carbon of an arc lamp, the
high temperature in both cases being altogether due to the incandescent
heat of the interposed arc or envelope. Facul&aelig; of intense
brightness will then appear upon the photosphere, and these will be
driven forward and also outward in the direction of the higher
latitudes, producing an oblique forward movement from difference of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>rotational speed at different portions of the
sun&rsquo;s surface. Similar phenomena are constantly observed on the
surface of the earth in the generation and behavior of cyclones and
other atmospheric disturbances. They may be compared to the wake of a
vessel anchored in a strong tide-way. These facul&aelig; will slowly
raise the temperature of the surface of the sun&rsquo;s core beneath to
the point of eruptive volatilization, and particularly so if the planet
is receding from, instead of advancing towards, the solar equator. At
some point in advance of the line of planetary energy an eruption of
volatilized metals will suddenly occur, first thrusting up a vast area
of the photosphere and then bursting it asunder, which will drive these
ruptured masses with enormous speed forward and obliquely outward from
the equator. Such facul&aelig; (see Proctor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Light
Science&rdquo;) sometimes reach a velocity of seven thousand miles per
minute, while the sun&rsquo;s rotational movement at the equator is
less than seventy miles per minute. This sudden eruption will be almost
immediately succeeded by great expansion and consequent fall of
temperature, so that within a few hours the heavy volatile metals begin
to condense and rapidly recede into their crater, and the facul&aelig;
in front and at the sides will now stream inward to occupy this vacuum
with constantly accelerated velocity, pouring over the edges like the
rush of waters at the Falls of Niagara. As they sweep downward over the
inner rim of the funnel, these streams of facul&aelig; will glow with
increased whiteness, and appear to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113"
href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>be sharply cut off at their
inner ends; but this is only apparently so, and is due to the position
of the observer, who looks almost directly downward upon these
descending streams. It is for the same reason that the facul&aelig;
appear more brilliant when near the borders of the solar disk (see page
109). Any good view of a sun-spot when analyzed will show the streams
of facul&aelig; thus pouring inward, and they are among the most
peculiar and conspicuous phenomena to be observed. The drawings of
Professor Langley, reproduced in the <i>Popular Science Monthly</i> for
September, 1874, and July, 1885, are particularly striking in their
illustration of these effects, though their significance and
interpretation were not then at hand.</p>

</div>
<p>But while these heavy metallic vapors so rapidly condense and
subside in the forward or initial portion of the sun-spot under
observation, new depths of intensely-heated facul&aelig; are generated
behind, and these operate with renewed energy upon the fresh surface of
the solar core in rear of the original seat of eruption; so that each
sun-spot, while in an active state, will exhibit two entirely distinct
aspects, the forward portion of the crater in a state of rapid
condensation and subsidence of the recently erupted metallic vapors,
and with inflowing streams of incandescent hydrogen from the front and
sides, and the rear portion of the crater up to its rearward wall, and
even streaming forth from beneath it, in a state of violent eruption.
The large volcanic craters of the Hawaiian Islands exhibit similar
partial eruptions and subsidences progressing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>simultaneously in the same depths. The sudden
formation of the great incandescent loops and plumes to which Professor
Langley calls especial attention, and which have hitherto been so
perplexing, can now be readily understood and explained. If one of
these inflowing streams be carried partially down into and across the
crater, and then caught, in its advance, by the uprush in the central
or rear portions of the cavity, it will be at once swept upward
alongside the ascending eruption, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115"
href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>and either scattered at its
forward extremity into sprays and plumes, or else thrown forward bodily
in the form of a more or less complete loop. In a sun-spot fifty
thousand miles in diameter, such a loop, having a long diameter of
twenty thousand miles, if we give a speed to the facul&aelig; of seven
thousand miles per minute, would be formed in about seven minutes,
during which the sun-spot would itself have advanced less than five
hundred miles across the face of the sun. The luminous bridges which
form so suddenly across portions of the crater may be explained in a
similar manner: they are streams of facul&aelig; floated on the nearly
balanced uprush of metallic vapors from beneath.</p>

the dark outer ring the corona. Loops and tufted sprays are shown,
caused by inflowing facul&aelig; in front, caught by the uprush of
active portions of the sun-spot towards rear.</p>
</div>
<p>It will thus be seen that a sun-spot is not merely a fixed eruption,
like a volcano, but rather a continuous series of eruptions, like a
line of activity following, for example, the great terrestrial volcanic
curve which extends up the western coast of America, across the Pacific
Ocean and Asia, and into Central and Southern Europe, for during its
progression its scene of action is constantly being shifted to the
rear; it is like a furrow cut by a plough, in which the upturned sod is
constantly falling in at one end of the furrow while the plough is
cutting a new furrow at the other, except that in this case the plough
is relatively fixed overhead, and the field itself passes along beneath
it. Consequently, the center of activity of a sun-spot is only in its
rear portions, generally considered, and the whole sun-spot is
gradually retreating, by successive filling up in front and opening out
behind, farther <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"
name="pb116">116</a>]</span>and farther to the rear,&mdash;that is to
say, to the east,&mdash;so that retardation relatively to the
rotational advance of the photosphere necessarily ensues.</p>
<p>But when the sun-spot is developed upon or near the equatorial line
this retardation is not so considerable, for the deeper layers of the
photosphere in those regions are slower to act and require greater
energy to affect them, so that all except deep and violent eruptions
fail to show themselves at the surface at all, and the heated
facul&aelig; are carried directly forward along the surface of the
equatorial swell, so that the center of activity is driven forward more
rapidly than in the higher latitudes, and the rate of progression is
more nearly coincident with that of the photosphere. But if these facts
are correctly stated and explained, we may have to revise our
calculations of the sun&rsquo;s rotational period, for retardation to
some extent must occur in all cases, if in any.</p>
<p>A sun-spot, we thus perceive, is an elongated wave or ridge of
eruption along the rotational direction of the sun&rsquo;s body. Why,
then, it may be asked, is not this line of eruption continuous entirely
around the sun? For the same reason, it may be answered, that our own
cyclones are not continuous, though caused substantially in the same
manner, and that volcanic eruptions only occur at long intervals,
though the forces at work are continuous. Lowering of temperature
follows swiftly after eruption, and as the deeper structures of the
solar nucleus become gradually affected, instead of volatilization of
the outer layers of the surface, we will have diffused gaseous
expansion of large portions, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>and finally of the entire solar
mass, which cannot as a whole be volatilized by any conceivable
planetary energy. We see these operations exemplified in heating a bar
of copper in a Bunsen flame; the latter first turns green from surface
volatilization of the copper, but as the heat is communicated to the
deeper structures the green flame disappears, and the whole additional
heat goes to raise the temperature of the mass.</p>
<p>These processes in the sun are thus seen to be self-compensatory in
their nature. They are the means provided to distribute the restricted
areas of abnormally heated photosphere over the solar surface, and
finally to cause the absorption of the whole excess of heat in the
sun&rsquo;s central mass. The balance is so evenly maintained, however,
that, were all the planets equally distributed with reference to the
sun&rsquo;s surface, such sun-spots would be the exception and not the
rule, and their distribution would be equal and constant; but, as the
planets continually change their positions with reference to the sun
and to each other, only by some such provision of nature could the
internal structure of the sun be maintained without serious
derangement, or, indeed, final disruption. So nature distributes her
stores of heat upon the earth. These beautiful self-compensations we
shall find suddenly appearing, as we advance, in all parts of the field
of astronomical research.</p>
<p>It may seem like temerity to advance statements so positive and
specific as to the cause, constitution, and progression of sun-spots,
in the absence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>of any considerable accumulation of observations
to sustain them, but the few examples which we have noted are in
accordance with these views, and when attention is once called to the
basic principles on which they depend, observations will doubtless be
made in abundance to prove or disprove what has been here stated. The
mere fact of a differential rate of advance among sun-spots, as they
pass across the solar face, of itself demonstrates that the active
causes of these phenomena must be extra-solar, and if so, their only
possible dynamic source must be looked for in the planets, and the
remaining conclusions will of necessity follow as a corollary. We may
even, by merely examining an accurate drawing of a sun-spot, determine
its position and direction upon the solar sphere from which it was
delineated by its lines of active eruption and influx of facul&aelig;,
and also whether it be a new spot or one which has passed entirely
beyond its active stage and is about to finally disappear.</p>
<p>As for the facul&aelig; which striate the photosphere, the mottlings
and so-called &ldquo;willow-leaves,&rdquo; any one who will quietly
gaze downward upon the turbid surface of the Mississippi or other
similar river, in mid-channel, will see plenty of such facul&aelig;:
the river is full of them. The heavier, intermingled clay, slowly
subsiding, is caught up in the turmoil beneath the surface and swept
upward in elongated ovals and eddies, the larger swells nearly
colorless, and others of all shades of ochre and yellow, and the whole
as richly mottled, sometimes, as the variegated pattern of a Persian
carpet. If we substitute <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href=
"#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>for the subsiding clay the rapidly
sinking heavy metallic vapors, and enlarge the scale from the
dimensions of the river to those of the sun, we will have the mottled
solar surface with its kaleidoscopic changes, the so-called
&ldquo;willow-leaves,&rdquo; and the facul&aelig; in all their glory. A
careful study of the sun will show most clearly that only in some such
explanation as the present view affords can a rational basis for its
varied phenomena be found.</p>

</div>
<p>If the sun&rsquo;s equator were coincident with the plane of the
planetary orbits, it is obvious that all the planetary energies would
be directed, whatever the position of the planets around the sun,
immediately upon this equatorial great circle, and that, at each
revolution upon his axis, corresponding nearly to our calendar month,
the same part of his sphere would be exposed to these direct currents,
so that the intensity would be, in its aggregate, nearly a constant
quantity. But, by reason of the sun&rsquo;s axial inclination of seven
degrees to the plane of the planetary orbits, a far more complex and
important condition of affairs ensues. It will be seen at once that the
plane of the planetary orbits intersects the sun&rsquo;s equator at
opposite sides, and that, from a minimum of nothing, this line reaches
a maximum, twice in each circumference, of seven degrees, one north and
the other south of the equator, and that this arc of fourteen degrees,
thus traversed by every planet in its orbital rotation around the sun,
measures more than one hundred thousand miles from north to south upon
the solar surface, nearly one-half the distance which separates the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>earth from the moon. If all the planets were in
conjunction or nearly so, on one side of the sun, for example, and in
the vertical plane of the sun&rsquo;s axis, they would continue to
deliver their electrical currents with their greatest intensity upon a
single point of his surface fifty-two thousand miles north of his
equator, while the opposite point, one hundred and four thousand miles
distant, would be unaffected by any direct currents at all. Conversely,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>if in conjunction on the opposite side of the
sun, they would continue to deliver these currents upon a corresponding
point fifty-two thousand miles south of the equator; but if in
conjunction in the vertical plane transverse to the sun&rsquo;s axial
inclination, these currents on either side of the sun would be
delivered directly upon the solar equator. The importance of this will
be understood when it is considered that for many of our years such
planets as Jupiter and Saturn must continue to direct their currents
upon a very slowly changing point of the sun&rsquo;s surface, by reason
of their vast annual rotational period, while with the earth and the
interior planets these various points are struck with ever-increasing
rapidity as the year decreases in length with the different planets,
the earth, Venus, and Mercury. There is a solar equinoctial, so to
speak, just as there is a terrestrial equinoctial in which the sun
crosses the line twice each year, and the meteorological disturbances
faintly shown on the earth at such times are vastly increased on the
sun, and rendered far more complex by the interaction of many planets
upon the sun, instead of a single sun upon each planet. While our
equinoctial has to do with gravity and light and heat, and probably
magnetism, the solar equinoctial deals with the vast electrical streams
which feed its fires and set it boiling with furious energy, first at
one point, then at another, until the increment has been absorbed and
adjusted, and thus equalized throughout his mass. What a new interest
this must arouse in our study of sun-spots, facul&aelig;, prominences,
sun-storms, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>and the vast panorama of solar action hung up
before our astonished eyes! A new world here awaits its Columbus.</p>
<p>But not only the planets thus gather, so to speak, electricity for
the sun&rsquo;s support from space; the moon also must do its part, as
it rotates in the same manner, subject to the sun, and has its own
motion through space. But an examination of the moon shows no
atmosphere and no aqueous matter visible to us, and also the singular
fact that it constantly presents one side only to the earth. R. Kalley
Miller, in his &ldquo;Romance of Astronomy,&rdquo; article &ldquo;The
Moon,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;After an elaborate analysis, Professor
Hausen, of Gotha, found that it could be accounted for only by
supposing that the side of the moon nearest us was lighter than the
other, and hence that its center of gravity was not at its center of
figure, but considerably nearer the side of it which is always turned
away from us. He calculates the distance between these centers to be
nearly thirty-five miles, evidently a most important eccentricity, when
we remember that the radius of the moon is little over a thousand
miles. It must have been produced by some great internal convulsion
after the moon assumed its solid state; but the forces required to
produce this disruption are less than might at first sight appear
necessary, owing to the fact that the force of gravitation and the
weight of matter are six times less at the moon than with us.&rdquo;
Those who are fond of the so-called &ldquo;Argument of Design&rdquo;
will be gratified to learn that, if the moon had a rotation upon its
own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>axis similar to that of the earth, all
life&mdash;past, present or future&mdash;would have been impossible on
that satellite or planet; and that, on the contrary,&mdash;provided she
always turns the same side of her surface to the earth,&mdash;it is
quite possible that air, water, and life may exist, or may have
existed, on the opposite side of the moon, but not otherwise. In fact,
air and water must now exist on the opposite side; and, since her whole
supply will thus be condensed upon half her surface or less, even with
her small force of gravity, it may be quite sufficient in quantity and
density for the support of animal, vegetable, or even human life. By
reason of this difference in the lunar center of gravity, the side
presented to the earth in physical position is similar to the summit of
a mountain upon the earth&rsquo;s surface two hundred miles high, and
surely we would not expect to find much air or water or life at that
altitude. But the opposite side would resemble a champagne country at
the foot of this enormous mountain, and might be well fitted for human
existence. Now, we know that similar electricities repel each other,
and air or gases charged with similar electricities are equally
self-repellent. Professor Tyndall, in his &ldquo;Lessons in
Electricity,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;The electricity escaping from a point
or flame into the air renders the air self-repulsive. The consequence
is, that when the hand is placed over a point mounted on the prime
conductor of a good machine, a cold blast is distinctly
felt&#8202;&hellip;. The blast is called the &lsquo;electric
wind.&rsquo; Wilson moved bodies by its action; Faraday caused it to
depress <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>the surface of a liquid; Hamilton employed the
reaction of the electric wind to make pointed wires rotate. The wind
was also found to promote evaporation.&rdquo;</p>

mutual repulsion of similar electricities; 6, mutual repulsion of
electrospheres of earth and moon; 7, mutual repulsion of electrospheres

</div>
<p>While electrical repulsion is doubtless analogous to, and
correlative with, the attraction of gravitation, this force, and even
gravity itself, has been sometimes interpreted as derived from the
mutually interacting molecules of space itself. We may even learn
somewhat of how such repulsions of similar and attractions of opposite
electrospheres might occur. We constantly speak of positive and
negative electricity as though these were different fluids, but such
expressions are employed only in the same manner as the analogous
terms, heat and cold. We know, of course, that cold is the relative
absence of heat, the dividing line being not a fixed, but a constantly
changing one, so that one body is cold to another by reason of
relative, and not absolute, deprivation of heat. It is well known,
however, that cold, which is purely a negative state, manifests the
same apparent radiant energy as heat. A vessel near an iceberg is
exposed to a wave of cold, precisely as of heat from a heated body at
the same distance. This, of course, is due to abstraction and not to
increment. All space being occupied by attenuated matter in a state of
unstable electrical equilibrium, as we say, which simply means a
condition ready to be raised or lowered in tension by absorption from
or into outside media, all concrete bodies floating in that space must
have an electrical potential <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href=
"#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>either equal to, or higher, or
else lower than that of their surrounding space. A solitary body in
space, if we can conceive of such, in either a higher or lower state of
electrical tension, would be drawn upon from all sides to equalize the
distribution and restore the general average. But if two bodies occupy
the same field, and are widely different from each other in electrical
potential, one higher and the other lower than that of space, this
distribution will be towards each other, and must be manifested by
mutual attraction. But if, on the contrary, these two bodies are both
equally higher or lower than the spatial average, they have nothing to
give to each other, but have this difference to give to or receive only
from outer space, and hence they will be drawn apart or, as we say,
mutually repelled. The case is similar to what we see in the case of
bodies of water at various levels. Suppose there be a lake of a fixed
level, and communicating with it and with each other, by open channels,
two ponds of water occupying an island in the middle of the lake. If
one of these ponds be higher in level and the other lower than the
lake, their waters will rapidly converge, the higher flowing into the
lower; but if both are at the same level, and higher than the lake,
they will flow apart into the lake. Or, if both are at the same level,
and lower than the lake, the water of the latter will equally flow from
outside into both ponds, and their waters will still be held separate
from each other. The analogies of these various levels may be pursued
to any desired extent, as electrical tensions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>find
their most exact analogies in the pressures of bodies of water at
different levels and of different quantities, and these analogies are
those most constantly used in the interpretation of such electrical
phenomena.</p>
<p>The great electrical activity of the electrospheres of the earth and
moon, while they discharge their tremendous currents directly into the
sun, at the same time must cause their similarly electrified
atmospheres to mutually repel each other, while gravity continues to
operate to maintain the earth and moon at their fixed distances from
each other, and to retain their gaseous envelopes around their own
bodies. The result must be that these similarly electrified atmospheres
repel each other with a force proportioned to their masses of
atmosphere and the intensity of the electricities of each. The
moon&rsquo;s axial rotation being completed but once in twenty-eight
days, and that of the earth once in each day, and the moon&rsquo;s mass
and volume being so much less than those of the earth, whatever of
electrified air or moisture she may have (and she must have both,
proportionate to her attributes) would have been driven as by a cyclone
to the opposite side of the moon and there retained. Now, with an
atmosphere and water only on one side of the moon, and that the side
opposite the earth, it is obvious that a rotation on her axis at all
resembling that of the earth would carry every part of her surface, at
each complete rotation, from a region of air and moisture into one
deprived of both, and in such a condition she would of necessity
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>be deprived of both life and its possibility;
hence, as the laws of nature compel the lunar atmosphere and moisture
to reside permanently on the side always opposite the earth, a
co-ordinate arrest of the moon&rsquo;s axial motion with reference to
the earth could alone compensate for such a state of things, and,
curiously enough, we find as a solitary exception, compared with the
planets, that such is the case. The moon unquestionably has both
atmosphere and water on its opposite side. In his recent work,
&ldquo;In the High Heavens,&rdquo; Professor Ball reviews the physical
conditions of the other planets as possible abodes of life. He
pronounces against the moon because night and day would each be a
fortnight in length; but this is surely no objection, for even in
Norway and Greenland such nights and days are not uncommon at different
seasons, and thousands of human beings, even as at present constituted
on earth, spend their lives there in content and happiness. That the
moon also would be terribly scorched by the long day and frozen by the
long night does not necessarily follow, for the atmosphere of Mars,
that author says, &ldquo;to a large extent mitigates the fierceness
with which the sun&rsquo;s rays would beat down on the globe if it were
devoid of such protection.&rdquo; As the moon&rsquo;s opposite face
must have a double quota both of atmosphere and clouds, the difficulty
will be correspondingly less than on Mars; and as for the
&ldquo;lightness&rdquo; of bodies on the moon, they would probably get
along quite as well as mosquitoes and like &ldquo;birds of prey&rdquo;
in the marshes along our coasts. The author refers <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>constantly to <i>our</i> bodies; for example,
&ldquo;Could <i>we</i> live on a planet like Neptune?&rdquo; No, we
could not; we would be dead before we got there. Nor could <i>we</i>
live in the bark of a tree, or at the bottom of the ocean, or in a
globule of serum; but living beings are found there nevertheless. The
principle is that wherever life is possible there we may expect to find
life; and surely life is, or has been, or will be possible, not only on
the moon, so far as our knowledge of physical conditions can go, but
also on some of the other planets. Of course each planet has its life
stage, but this applies not only to the earth, but to all the other
planets as well, and not only to the planets of our own system, but to
those of all other solar systems. Each has had, or will have, its stage
in which life is possible, and these planets may be like human
habitations, in which whole races at times migrate from one home to
another. There is no conceivable reason why this may not be the general
law of creation, and every analogy leads us to believe that it is
so.</p>
<p>It has been recently announced that, from telescopic observations,
the atmosphere of Mars must be at least as attenuated as that among the
highest mountainous regions of the earth, if this planet has any
atmosphere at all. That it must be far less dense than that of the
earth at sea-level is obvious, for the mass and volume of Mars are very
much less than those of our own planet; but that Mars is devoid of a
gaseous envelope or atmosphere is contrary to what we know of all
sidereal physics. The sun, the fixed stars, the comets, the
nebul&aelig;, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130"
name="pb130">130</a>]</span>even the meteorolithic fragments which fall
upon the earth, all show the same elementary chemical constitution as
the earth itself, and we cannot believe that Mars alone is differently
constituted from every other body we have been able to examine. We have
direct evidence, on this planet, of polar snows and their melting away
under the sun&rsquo;s heat; we see the apparent areas of sea and land;
it has its moons as the earth has hers, and exhibits all the
characteristic phenomena of the earth and other planets. All sidereal
bodies that we know of, except, perhaps, our moon, which exception we
have fully accounted for, are found to be surrounded by gaseous
envelopes or atmospheres of some sort. The sun, the fixed stars, the
nuclei of comets, the condensing nebul&aelig;, the planets Jupiter and
the earth, which are those under our most direct observation, and even
the meteorites, when examined, reveal the presence of many times their
own volumes of independent atmospheric gases; and whatever may be the
theory of the origin or development of Mars, it must have been
subjected to the same influences, the same environment, and the same
processes of creation as those of our solar system generally; and that
this body alone should possess no gaseous envelope&mdash;for the denial
of atmosphere denies, at the same time, the presence of any or all
surrounding gases&mdash;is quite incredible. Only the most positive,
direct, and long-continued proofs of such fact could be accepted, and
even then the history of all scientific progress shows that what are
believed to be facts themselves fluctuate like fancies till, by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>their accumulated force, they solidify into
universally accepted demonstration. The fact, moreover, that the
atmospheres of the smaller planets are more attenuated than our own and
those of the larger ones denser has no bearing, in itself, on the
probability of the existence of life on these other planets, for in our
own atmosphere oxygen, which is the efficient element, is diluted with
four times its quantity of inert nitrogen. These proportions doubtless
vary largely in other atmospheres, so that the oxygen may be much
richer in some and far poorer, relatively, in others. The mere fact
that the presence of nitrogen, probably, and aqueous vapor, certainly,
depends on the gravity of the mass of each planet, while the oxygen is
due to electrolytic decomposition induced by the combined volume, mass,
and rotation, and other causes,&mdash;such as the axial inclination of
such planets, for example,&mdash;renders these variations in the
constitution of planetary atmospheres a certainty. As Mars has a
diameter much more than one-half that of the earth, and a diurnal
rotational period nearly the same, while his mass, which controls the
action of gravity, is only about one-ninth that of the earth (see
Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia), it is obvious that his
oxygen-gathering power, compared with that for accumulating nitrogen
and aqueous vapor, is much higher than that of the earth, and we should
expect to find there an attenuated atmosphere very rich in oxygen, and
with a relatively smaller proportion of aqueous vapor, or even water,
on his surface. Such seem to be the facts as far as observed.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>In operating an electric machine the strength of the current is
directly proportionate to the speed of rotation,&mdash;that is to say,
to the velocity of the generating surface; for example, of the
Wimshurst induction machine it is stated (page 63, &ldquo;Electricity
in the Service of Man&rdquo;), &ldquo;These four-and-one-half inch
discharges take place <i>in regular succession at every two and a half
turns</i> of the handle.&rdquo; It is also a well-established law of
electrolysis that &ldquo;The amount of decomposition effected by the
current is in proportion to the current strength.&rdquo; Professor
Ferguson (&ldquo;Electricity,&rdquo; page 225) says of the voltameter,
an instrument devised by Faraday, and used for testing the strength of
currents by the proportionate decomposition of acidulated water,
&ldquo;Mixed gases rise into the tube, and <i>the quantity of gas given
off in a given time measures the strength of the current</i>.&rdquo;
Roughly estimating the diameter of Mars at five-eighths, the surface
velocity at three-fifths, and the mass at one-ninth those of the earth,
this planet should have an atmosphere containing about sixty per cent.
of oxygen and forty of nitrogen, with a barometric pressure at
sea-level of about six and one-half inches of mercury. This would be an
excellent atmosphere,&mdash;about equal in its quota of oxygen for each
respiration to that of the higher areas of Persia, a great country for
roses. The aqueous vapors lying low and near the surface would serve as
a vaporous screen to concentrate and retain the sun&rsquo;s heat and
retard radiation from that planet. Nothing in particular seems to be
the matter with Mars. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the contrary, the mass of Jupiter is so great, and his attraction
of gravity so powerful, that it is only by his exceedingly rapid
diurnal rotation (once in less than ten hours) that it is possible for
him to accumulate any effective percentage of oxygen at all. But there
is certainly plenty of water there.</p>
<p>We may approximately compute, in general terms, the proportion of
oxygen in the atmospheres of the other planets in the same way.
Neptune, it is true, is so far distant from the sun that the solar orb
only &ldquo;appears about the same magnitude as Venus when at its
greatest brilliancy, as viewed from the earth,&rdquo; but we must not
forget that &ldquo;the <i>intensity</i> of the sun&rsquo;s light would
be more than ten thousand times greater than that of Venus&rdquo;
(Professor Dunkin, in &ldquo;The Midnight Sky&rdquo;). Unless the moon
gathers a portion of the earth&rsquo;s oxygen (the planetary
satellites, like Saturn&rsquo;s rings, thus constituting in their
rotations a constituent part of the planets themselves), the percentage
of this gas in her atmosphere must be exceedingly small, for her axial
rotation has a period of a whole lunar month, being the same as that of
her revolution around the earth as a center.</p>
<p>The absence of apparent atmosphere and moisture from the
<i>visible</i> lunar surface has already been mentioned and explained.
The means by which this fact has been approximately determined are
described by Professor Dunkin, in &ldquo;The Midnight Sky,&rdquo; as
follows: &ldquo;Among the many proofs of the non-existence of a lunar
atmosphere, it may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134"
name="pb134">134</a>]</span>be mentioned that no water can be seen; at
least there is not a sufficient quantity in any one spot so as to be
visible from the earth. Again, there are no clouds; for if there were,
we should immediately discover them by the variable light and shade
which they would produce. But one great proof of the absence of any
large amount of vapor being suspended over the lunar surface is the
sudden extinction of a star when occulted by the moon. The author has
been a constant observer of these phenomena, and, though his experience
is of long standing, he has never observed an occultation of a star or
planet, <i>especially at the unilluminated edge of a young moon</i>,
without having his conviction confirmed that there is no appreciable
lunar atmosphere&#8202;&hellip;. Professor Challis has subjected the
results of a large number of these observations to a severe
mathematical test, but he has not been able to discover the slightest
trace of any effect produced by a lunar atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia, article &ldquo;The
Moon,&rdquo; it is stated that &ldquo;Schr&ouml;ter (about 1800)
claimed to have discovered indications of vegetation on the surface of
the moon. These consist of certain traces of a greenish tint which
appear and reappear periodically; much as the white spots covering the
polar regions of Mars&#8202;&hellip;. As we are able, under the most
favorable conditions, to use upon the moon telescopic powers which have
the effect of bringing the satellite to within one hundred and fifty to
one hundred and twenty miles of us, we should doubtless notice any such
marked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>changes on her surface as the passage of the
seasons produces, for example, on our own globe.&rdquo; Very recently
(August 12, 1894), it has been stated, Professor Gathmann has observed
a peculiar green spot about forty by seventy miles in area near the
crater of Tycho Brahe, &ldquo;on the <i>northwestern edge</i> of the
satellite&rsquo;s upper limb,&rdquo; which had disappeared twenty-two
hours afterwards.</p>
<p>We understand, of course, that the moon&rsquo;s librations, by the
variation of position of the lunar body, enable us to see, at times,
around the edge of this satellite somewhat, so that, instead of
observing only one-half, we can in this way see nearly six-tenths of
her surface, but not at the same time, of course. When the moon is dark
it occupies a position between the earth and the sun, and only its
opposite face is illuminated. In this position the attraction of solar
gravity and the attraction of the electrically opposite solar
electrosphere both accumulate their forces upon the moon&rsquo;s
atmosphere in the same line as the repulsion of the earth&rsquo;s
similar electricity, so that the lunar moisture and atmosphere are, at
this part of her subordinate orbit, most powerfully forced away from
the direction of the earth. As the moon now proceeds towards her first
quarter, the terrestrial repulsion drives her atmosphere radially
outward, while solar gravity and electrical attraction tend to hold it
in the direction of the sun. The result will be an electrospheric
libration, so to speak, and the moon&rsquo;s atmosphere and moisture
will be carried around towards its illuminated face and, to some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>extent, will overlap the area of terrestrial
repulsion. But as the moon advances this will gradually diminish, soon
cease, and finally be reversed as it again approaches darkness. We can
now understand why the green surface, if it really was due to
vegetation, appeared along the <i>lunar margin</i> at the time
described above, and also that the observation of planetary
occultations &ldquo;at the unilluminated edge of the young moon&rdquo;
was the very worst part of the moon and its orbit in which to look for
air or moisture; as the sun&rsquo;s influence is then directly <i>away
from</i> the unilluminated surface of the moon, and his
&ldquo;pull&rdquo; would have, in fact, still further denuded the very
portion most persistently examined, and where this absence of
atmosphere was <i>especially</i> noted.</p>
<p>When considering the transference of energy from the peripheral
regions of the solar system to the center, its conversion there into a
new form of molecular force, and its subsequent distribution, we find a
curious and instructive parallel in the action of the reflex nervous
system of animal life. This system is one in which the brain or other
conscious center of nerve-energy takes no part. Tickle the foot of a
child, for example, and its whole muscular system is thrown into
uncontrollable convulsions of laughter. Here an exciting contact with
the terminal filaments of the afferent or sensory nerves is rapidly
carried into the local nerve-center of this part of the
system,&mdash;that is, the sensory column of the spinal cord. This
center of ganglionic nerve-matter lies directly against the
corresponding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>motor mass, both freely communicating with each
other. The sensory current passing into its central ganglion undergoes
some peculiar change of character, probably one of intensification,
such as is observed in the action of the condenser of an electrical
machine, through which sensory ganglion, thus raised in potential, it
passes to the motor ganglion adjacent, where it is instantly
transformed into an entirely different form of energy. The sensory
character has now entirely disappeared, and it has been converted into
and is flashed forth as motor energy to the different muscles of the
body, which are immediately contracted, the violent molecular motion of
the fibres being at once converted into muscular motion in mass. The
changes are entirely analogous to those we see in the different
conversions of energy in our solar system. Considering the surface of
the body as a planetary electrosphere, it is acted upon by excitation
from without; currents of energy are engendered, which are at once
transmitted to the sensory ganglion, corresponding to the hydrogen
atmosphere or electrosphere of the sun; intensification of action here
ensues, the current passing through this ganglion or atmosphere into
the solar body itself, which corresponds to the motor ganglion; both
ganglia are now highly excited; the electrical force is converted into
the radiant molecular motor energy of heat and light in the sun and
muscular excitement in the body, and these are flashed forth and find
scope for their action within the body of the subject or upon the
surface of the planets, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138"
href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>lie, like the muscular
structure of the body, within the genetic electrosphere where, acted
upon from without and by agencies entirely external, moving contact has
induced the primary molecular action, which was then instantaneously
transferred to the center, there converted into another form, that of
motor energy, and thence sent forth to produce action in the muscles of
the body in the one case, and in the other upon the planetary bodies
and their satellites and other structures which occupy surrounding
space. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=

<h2 class="main">THE DISTRIBUTION AND CONSERVATION OF SOLAR
ENERGY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What, then, becomes of the light and heat flashed
forth with eternal energy from the fiery waves of the sun&rsquo;s
incandescent atmosphere? Professor Ball (&ldquo;In the High
Heavens&rdquo;) says, &ldquo;Much of what has been said with regard to
light may be repeated with regard to heat. We know that radiant heat
consists of ethereal undulations of the same character as the waves of
light. Hence we see that the heat or the light radiated from a glowing
gas is mainly provided at the expense of the energy possessed by the
molecules in virtue of their internal oscillations.&rdquo; Conversely,
of course, the ethereal undulations thus induced by high molecular
motion in the heated gas or vapor must disappear in so-called
absorption or transference by contact with other molecules, themselves
devoid of such specific internal oscillations. The heat motion then
disappears as heat by its conversion into work, just as the motion of a
belt in a mill disappears in the work of the machine which it drives.
One two-hundred-and-thirty-two-millionth part of the radiant solar
energy, we know, is caught by the flying planets of our system in the
forms of heat and light, adapted to sustain life and its continued
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>potentiality, and we know that this solar energy
is the sole source of all the development and maintenance of the
planets as the possible abodes of organic life, past, present or
future.</p>
<p>But what of the vast total, of which we consume so minute a
fraction? It is true that, in addition to the planets, space is
occupied by many small meteoric bodies, which manifest themselves to us
as shooting stars and meteorites, but the mass of these is too trifling
to be estimated. Professor Helmholtz, in his &ldquo;Popular Scientific
Lectures,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;According to Alexander Herschel&rsquo;s
estimates, each stone is, on an average, at a distance of four hundred
and fifty miles from its neighbors.&rdquo; When these bodies enter our
atmosphere by force of the earth&rsquo;s attraction they are heated by
its atmospheric friction to incandescence, and in most cases are even
volatilized before reaching the earth&rsquo;s surface. The vast volumes
of solar heat and light, however, are poured forth from the sun
indiscriminately in all directions into illimitable space, wherein all
the masses of concrete matter, including the stars, are relatively far
less in volume than the flying motes of the purest morning air which
sparkle in the flood of light sent forth by the rising sun. Is all the
rest wasted? Professor Balfour Stewart, in his work &ldquo;The
Conservation of Energy,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;If this be the fate of the
high-temperature energy of the universe, let us think for a moment what
will happen to its visible energy. We have spoken already about a
medium pervading space, the office of which appears to be to degrade
and ultimately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>extinguish all differential motion, just as it
tends to reduce and ultimately equalize all difference in temperature.
Thus, the universe would ultimately become an equally heated mass,
utterly worthless as far as the production of work is concerned, since
such production depends upon difference of temperature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is obvious that the starting-point taken by the author last
quoted, but which, nevertheless, is in accordance with the views now
generally prevalent, is diametrically opposed to that sought to be
established in this work. Professor Stewart takes the sun&rsquo;s
inherent energy as the initial point of departure, and reasons from
that as to the final consequence when all its light and heat shall have
been distributed or dissipated into the attenuated medium which
occupies space, and which will be thus slowly heated until all space
has been raised in temperature to that of the last dying sun, when all
will thenceforth remain unchanged and unchangeable, silent, dark, and
dead, to all eternity. On the contrary, the purpose of the present work
is to establish a directly opposite principle, based, however, on
demonstrated scientific facts and not on theory, that the medium which
pervades all space was originally in the same equally and universally
potential state (with its molecules raised to a tension constituting an
unstable equilibrium) in which, practically, Professor Stewart&rsquo;s
argument leaves it finally, and that this universal molecular energy of
position was permanently maintained by the employment of the forces
which afterwards, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>transformed into light and heat, were shed
abroad by the sun in the work of again overcoming the intermolecular
tension of cohesion, and that the light and heat of the sun are merely
caught up again by these same or other molecules and successively
employed in the same manner, while the planetary electrospheres utilize
these same forces of internal tension in the generation of electricity,
which, sent to the sun, is converted into light and heat, and these are
again transferred to their original source. The rotation of the planets
is the grand exciting cause, and the process, in its complete cycle of
development, has live stages: first, planetary generation; second,
transference by currents of electricity to the sun; third, conversion
into light and heat; fourth, emission; and, fifth, reabsorption and
conversion again into molecular energy of position. All space is thus
found to be pervaded by extremely attenuated vapors, which contain the
elemental constituents out of which suns and planets are evolved under
favorable circumstances of development, and, among other vapors,
aqueous vapor, and that these are the agency upon which the planetary
electrospheres operate in their generation of electrical currents, and
which vapors, in turn, by absorption of the solar energy of radiation,
again transform this energy into mutually balanced electric potential,
until it is once more disengaged as electricity by the rotating
planetary electrospheres, and so on in a constant circuit forever
repeated. It differs from perpetual motion, however, in that the
planetary rotation is the external <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143"
href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>and not the internal
generative cause, since the electrical forces neither cause nor control
these motions; they belong to the realm of gravity. The disassociation,
moreover, is electrical and not chemical disassociation. The tensions
are against cohesion and not against chemical affinity; are, in fact,
similar to those which constitute our atmosphere a vast electrical
reservoir; and the aqueous vapors, through all their changes,
permanently remain as aqueous vapors, except those condensed portions
disassociated by electrolytic action at the electrospheric poles, and
which have no relation to the attenuated vapors of space, except in
that the latter are their sources of supply. The process is analogous
to what we see around us at all times in the atmosphere. While the
process described by Professor Stewart resembles the emptying of the
inherent water of a cloud, in the form of rain, into an ocean which
never yields up its water again, so that, when the cloud has rained
itself out, it is gone forever, the processes here sketched are like
the vapors which are caught up by the heated air, carried over the
thirsty lands, distributed in rain to fertilize and vivify them, then
gathered in a thousand tiny rills from countless fountains, again
descending to the sea and again carried up in vapor, and so on over and
over in unceasing round. It is the difference between an old-fashioned
flintlock musket and a modern magazine rifle, except that the magazine
is always full.</p>
<p>This great ocean of space was primordially charged with these
potential vapors; it is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>constitution of space itself. We
are so accustomed to consider space as empty, and that it is
nothingness, the antithesis of something or anything, that it is a
negation or a blank, that it requires an effort to even think of it as
a fully stocked establishment with all the goods necessary for use or
ornament, in the latest styles and of prime quality, only not made up,
and that all our suns and worlds are merely tailoring establishments
where the operatives cut and fit and make them up to order. When more
goods are wanted they have to go to the store.</p>
<p>Is space, then, eternal, and is this constant round of energies to
be eternal? If one is eternal, so is the other, and surely nothing can
be more eternal than space, and we cannot conceive of any other space
than this space. Out of it came all created things, and so long as the
orbs rotate without retardation, so long will these interchanges go on
without impairment, and that they do so rotate is the necessary
corollary of the fact that they ever began to rotate. If rotation, on
the contrary, was imparted by special creative power, then the same
power established the laws by which they rotate, and took cognizance of
resistance as well. Whatever the impulse was, it still remains;
whatever caused the rotation to begin maintains it; if the cause is
eternal the rotation may be eternal; and, in any case, its period must
be measured by cycles of &aelig;ons, to which the allotted lifetime of
a dying sun&mdash;a few million years, perhaps&mdash;is but as the
sunburst of a morning-glory flower to the hoary age of a mighty planet.
Compared with the popular <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href=
"#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>view of the sun&rsquo;s
life-period, we may formulate the terms of an equation in which the
sun&rsquo;s mass, compared with the realms of infinite space, is as the
sun&rsquo;s lifetime&mdash;on a basis of contraction of his
volume&mdash;to the lifetime which actually is to be. As one of the
terms is practically infinite, so must be the answer to the problem.
Professor Stewart says, &ldquo;We cannot help believing that there is a
material medium of some kind between the sun and the earth; indeed, the
undulatory theory of light requires this belief.&rdquo; It has already
been shown that the transmission of electricity also requires it, but
that there must be a medium quite different from the undulatory ether.
Professor Proctor (&ldquo;Mysteries of Time and Space&rdquo;) says,
&ldquo;We may admit the possibility that the aqueous vapor and carbon
compounds are present in stellar or interplanetary space.&rdquo; Again
he says, &ldquo;Assuming, as we well may, that space is really occupied
by attenuated vapors.&rdquo; The same writer says further, &ldquo;To
this end all thoughtful study of the mechanism seems to tend
(associating, perhaps, our visible universe with others, permeating it
as the ether of space permeates the densest solids, and in turn with
others so permeated by it); there may be that constant interchange,
that perpetual harmony, of which Goethe sung:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Balanced worlds from change defending,</p>
<p class="line">While everywhere diffused is harmony
unending.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The light and heat poured forth from the sun are, as
stated, in the form of radiated energy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>They penetrate the
attenuated vapors as far as vision extends, and doubtless farther, but
they cannot reach the boundaries of space, for even the mind of man
cannot reach those limits. Aqueous vapor absorbs heat; we know this
without any demonstration, for the radiated heat of the earth is
arrested by a veil of clouds, so that on cloudy nights frost will not
form. So also the sun shining into water will raise its temperature, as
in a glass globe, and such absorption of heat by aqueous vapors or
water would be much more manifest were not a large part employed in
loosening the tension of the constituent molecules, since, when thus
employed, it is not manifest as sensible heat. Professor Tyndall, in
&ldquo;The Forms of Water,&rdquo; states that &ldquo;The quantity of
heat which would raise the temperature of a pound of water one degree
would raise the temperature of a pound of iron ten degrees.&rdquo;
Professor Stewart, in &ldquo;The Conservation of Energy,&rdquo; says,
&ldquo;That peculiar motion which is imparted by heat when absorbed
into a body is, therefore, one variety of molecular
energy&#8202;&hellip;. Part of the energy of absorbed heat is spent in
pulling asunder the molecules of the body under the attractive force
which binds them together, and thus a store of <i>energy of
position</i> is laid up, which disappears again after the body is
cooled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heat will only be changed into work while it passes from a
body of high temperature to one of low&#8202;&hellip;. At very high
temperatures it is possible that most compounds are decomposed, and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>temperature at which this takes place, for any
compound, has been termed its temperature of disassociation. <i>Heat
energy is changed into electrical separation</i> when tourmalines and
certain other crystals are heated.&rdquo; It may be added that it is
also changed into electrical energy by the operation of all electrical
machines, as molecular motions are all mutually interconvertible, and
heat itself is only a mode of such motion. Of radiant energy, the same
writer says, &ldquo;This form of energy [radiant heat] is converted
into absorbed heat whenever it falls upon an opaque substance &hellip;
and heats it. It is a curious question to ask what becomes of the
<i>radiant light</i> from the sun that is not absorbed either by the
planets of our system or by any of the stars. We can only reply to such
a question that, <i>as far as we can judge from our present
knowledge</i>, the radiant energy that is not absorbed must be
conceived to be traversing space at the rate of one hundred and
eighty-eight thousand miles a second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We know, of course, that aqueous vapors are partially opaque to heat
rays, as the radiated heat of the earth is partially arrested by such
vapors in the atmosphere, but they are apparently transparent to the
rays of light. But we know that this cannot be entirely true in fact,
for light rays only differ from heat rays in the comparative length of
their waves or impulses, while rays of light are always
accompanied&mdash;when emitted by a thermally incandescent
body&mdash;by a much larger number of those of heat. As a body is
raised in temperature radiant dark rays first appear; these being
raised higher, become <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>visible as light, and new dark
rays are radiated behind them, and this continues till after the state
of highest incandescence is reached and the invisible chemical rays
beyond the spectrum appear. It is like a crowd surging forth in flight
from the doors of a building; as the speed of those in front increases
to a run, others follow more slowly in the mass, and as these gain
speed others continue to follow, while the great mass of laggards still
trails along in a lengthening line to the rear. The perception of light
is itself merely due to the constitution of the optic apparatus of the
observer, which only takes cognizance of vibrations radiated from the
middle portion of the scale, just as the ear does with sounds, and not
to any actual difference in their mode of production. That heat rays
and light rays are identical in constitution can be readily shown by
the experiment described by Professor Tyndall in his &ldquo;Forms of
Water,&rdquo; in which an opaque screen of iodine solution in
bisulphide of carbon was employed to arrest, in a beam of light, all
the light waves (to which it is entirely opaque), while transmitting
the dark rays. These non-luminous rays are then converged by a lens:
&ldquo;Let us, then, by means of our opaque solution, isolate our dark
waves and converge them on the cotton. It explodes as
before&#8202;&hellip;. At the same dark focus sheets of platinum are
raised to vivid redness; &hellip; a diamond is caused to glow like a
star, being afterwards gradually dissipated.&rdquo; Sir William
Herschel (see article &ldquo;Spectrum,&rdquo; Appleton&rsquo;s
Cyclop&aelig;dia) says, &ldquo;If we call light those rays which
illuminate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>objects, and radiant heat those which heat
bodies, it may be inquired whether light be essentially different from
radiant heat. In answer to which I would suggest that we are not
allowed by the rules of philosophizing to admit of two different causes
to explain certain effects, if they may be accounted for by
one.&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;Tyndall, by similar experiments, found that
the thermal energy of the invisible radiation of a very powerful
electric light is eight times that of the visible&#8202;&hellip;.
Seebeck showed that the position of maximum heat in the spectrum
changes with the nature of the prism and sometimes occurs in the
red.&rdquo; Melconi, with prisms of alcohol and water, found it in the
yellow. Athermic bands are also found in the heat-spectrum,
corresponding to the Fraunhofer lines seen in the visible spectrum.</p>
<p>We may illustrate this successive development of more and more rapid
light-waves by conceiving of a harp having musical strings of various
length and thickness, but not strung up, so that, when swept by the
hand, the vibrations are felt, but no musical tones are produced. If,
now, all the strings are simultaneously and gradually stretched while
under continuous vibration, we will first hear the hum of the lighter
strings, but deep down in the scale; and as the tension gradually
increases the pitch of these will rise higher and higher and be
succeeded by other new tones below, until the whole register is
simultaneously sounded. And if the tension be further increased, the
vibrations of the upper strings will gradually grow so rapid that the
ear can take no cognizance of them, corresponding <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>to
the invisible chemical rays of the spectrum, while the middle strings
will be sounding loudly, and others will be slowly vibrating below the
musical scale, but without sound, corresponding to the invisible heat
rays. In addition to this gradual ascent of pitch along the scale,
however, there is reason to believe that sympathetic vibrations are
induced in the spectrum of thermal and chemical light corresponding to
the over-tones in music and to those hidden rhythms which differentiate
the &ldquo;timbre&rdquo; of one kind of musical instrument from that of
another, so that a definite wave-length will not only repeat itself
among adjacent molecules, but will give rise to harmonious vibrations
quite different in amplitude and velocity. An example of this is found
in some of the phenomena of phosphorescence and fluorescence, in which
chemical rays totally invisible are able, under suitable conditions, to
excite molecular movements corresponding to parts of the visible
spectrum, and quite different in wave-lengths and in rapidity. This
process is precisely the converse of what we perceive in thermal light;
in the latter case the colors ascend, loaded with invisible heat rays;
in the former they descend, loaded with invisible chemical rays, only
noted, perhaps, by their actinic action on the photographic plate.
Others, as the sulphide of calcium paints and the like, repeat their
own vibrations for many hours, and we find in certain chemical salts of
some rare metals, as lanthanum and cerium, the curious property of
suddenly raising the whole scale, as in a recently introduced
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>gas-lamp, in which a skeleton mantle of these
oxides glows with a wondrously beautiful white light under the
relatively low temperature of a small Bunsen burner; similar phenomena
are manifested in the behavior of electric discharges in attenuated
gases, as well as in what is known to children as
&ldquo;fox-fire,&rdquo; wood undergoing slow decomposition in damp
places, or in the self-luminous secretions (corresponding, perhaps, to
ptomaines or like products) of glow-worms and other animals. If we
ever&mdash;as we probably soon shall&mdash;reach that point where we
can illuminate our dwellings with &ldquo;cold candles,&rdquo; as the
inhabitants of tropical countries carry about a few fire-flies in a
paper box for a lantern on dark nights, it must be by the study of
these phenomena. But meantime &ldquo;Old Sol&rdquo; will continue to
discharge his accumulating stores of both heat and light, for both
these are essential, not only for use upon the planets, but throughout
all the realms of space. In the transformation into and emission of his
radiant energy the sun is not a chemical engine, but a mill,&mdash;one
of those which &ldquo;grind slowly, but they grind exceeding
small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The difference between radiated thermal light and heat is obviously
one of degree only and not of kind. The undulations of light may be
compared to the thrust of a rapier, and the more massive waves of
radiant heat to the blow of a bludgeon, but the same resistance which
arrests the advance of the one must retard and finally arrest that of
the other, if sufficiently extended. Within the limits of a space in
which Professor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span>Stewart conceives that the first rays of
light which ever flashed forth at the dawn of creation, in the primal
&aelig;ons of the universe, are still to this day, along their original
lines of radiation, &ldquo;traversing space at the rate of one hundred
and eighty-eight thousand miles per second,&rdquo; there must certainly
be room enough and absorption enough (which even a few yards of mist
will supply) to curb these runaway steeds somewhere along their lines
of flaming passage. At that very point they are at work acting upon the
molecules of the attenuated vapors of space, and assisting to
re-establish the potential energy which has there been converted, into
another form of force by the planetary rotations of the solar systems
of those distant regions. By the law of the diffusion of gases, and
that of the diffusion or transference of heat-energy from molecule to
molecule, the vast realms of interstellar space must tend to be all
brought into approximate uniformity of tensions, and the force
abstracted at those points of space occupied by the relatively few and
insignificant solar systems will be returned, not directly at the
identical places where such solar systems may exist, but at every part
of space to which their radiant energy extends. As we give from our own
supplies to other systems for their support, so they, in turn, give
back again to us. It is said that in the earliest days of creation the
stars sang together; they still sing together, planets and suns, as</p>

aloud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When old Earth lifts his brimming beaker from the great crystal sea
and drains it to the good health of all the stars of heaven, they each
respond with fiery energy, and by their merry twinkle we may know how
highly they appreciate the toast. We are all one family,&mdash;but what
a family! Comets, planets, double stars, variable stars, stars of
complementary colors, blue, yellow, orange, and red stars, stars which
blaze up in sudden conflagration, apparently new stars, nebul&aelig;
half star and half vapor, nebul&aelig; all vapor and others all stars,
the vast milky-way like a wondrous river of hundreds of millions of
solar systems, the insulated stars scattered through space like
watchmen on the distant hills beyond the city walls, streams of stars,
stars which are parting from each other in space like scattering
families, and those which travel together in groups like pioneers in a
strange country,&mdash;all these and doubtless other unknown types and
forms compose this sidereal family. Will they fall into their
categories as lawful subjects, so as to be properly classified in a
single scheme of the visible order of creation, or shall we fail to
interpret their apparent mysteries when we apply the same principles
which have been successfully applied to the phenomena of our own solar
system? Let us see.</p>
<p>In examining the sun, we find that a beam of its light passed
through a prism is thrown upon the wall in a wedge-shaped streak of
rainbow-tinted colors. Fraunhofer, many years ago, found that this
spectrum was crossed at irregular intervals <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>by a
series of dark lines, of variable width and distance apart, of which he
catalogued more than five hundred. These lines were subsequently found
to correspond in the aggregate, in their position in the spectrum, with
a series of bright lines of different colors which formed the separate
spectra of various metals when burned, in vapor or powder, in the flame
of an alcohol lamp. Each of these transverse lines was found to have a
fixed and invariable position in the extended scale of the spectrum,
and scarcely any lines of the different elements are alike; so that,
when the spectrum is properly magnified under telescopic observation
and the lines identified, we have the means of determining the presence
or absence of such elements in the vaporous constitution of any
incandescent body by examination of its spectrum. In this way many of
our terrestrial elements are found to exist in the sun,&mdash;so many,
in fact, that we know that the sun&rsquo;s nucleus, or core, must be
composed substantially of the same elements, the same sort of matter,
as exists on earth,&mdash;that we are, in fact, &ldquo;a chip of the
old block.&rdquo; But it was found&mdash;and this is the real basis of
spectrum analysis&mdash;that if a certain metal or other element be
burned in the flame of an alcohol lamp, and a more brilliant flame of
the same metal or element burned in another lamp be observed through
the first flame, it will be seen that, &ldquo;while the general
illumination of the spectrum is increased, the previous bright lines
characterizing the element are now replaced by dark lines or lines
relatively very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155"
name="pb155">155</a>]</span>faint; in a word, the spectrum
characteristic of the given element is exactly reversed&rdquo;
(Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia, article &ldquo;Spectrum
Analysis&rdquo;). We have referred to this fact above in considering
the origin of sun-spots, showing that they are due to increased heat
acting upon the core of the sun so as to volatilize an abnormally large
proportion of the elements usually in a more condensed state upon the
surface of the solar body beneath its hydrogen envelope. These vapors,
thus raised in temperature, are driven upward by their volatilization
into the incandescent atmosphere of hydrogen, and the vaporous matters
in the higher strata thus produce the characteristic absorption bands
of these elements, while the overheated <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>vapors, by a vast
uprush from beneath, hurl aside the more highly heated hydrogen above
to appear as facul&aelig; around the sun-spot, the cooler upper layers
of hydrogen following downward the subsiding vaporous metallic uprush
as it sinks back beneath the photospheric level.</p>

<p>It is obvious that by similar spectrum analysis we may determine to
a large extent the constitution of the fixed stars and other
self-luminous bodies of space and interpret the phenomena which they
exhibit. We quote the following from the previously cited article in
Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia, by Professor Proctor:
&ldquo;Spectroscopic analysis applied to the stars has shown that they
resemble the sun in general constitution and condition. But
characteristic differences exist, insomuch that the stars have been
divided into four orders distinguished by their spectra. These are thus
presented by Secchi, who examined more than five hundred star spectra:
The first type is represented by Alpha Lyr&aelig;, Sirius, etc., and
includes most of the stars shining with a white light, as Altair,
Regulus, Rigel, the stars Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Zeta, and Eta of Ursa
Major, etc. These give a spectrum showing all the seven colors, and
crossed usually by many lines, but <i>always by the four lines of
hydrogen, very dark and strong</i>. The breadth of these four lines
indicates a very deep, absorptive stratum at a high temperature and at
great pressure. <i>Nearly half the stars</i> observed by Secchi [more
than two hundred out of five hundred] showed this spectrum. The second
type includes most of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>yellow stars, as Capella, Pollux,
Arcturus, Aldebaran, Alpha of Ursa Major, Procyon, etc. The Fraunhofer
lines are well seen in the red and blue, but not so well in the yellow.
<i>The resemblance of this spectrum to the sun</i> suggests that stars
of this type resemble the sun closely in physical constitution and
condition. About one-third of the stars observed by Secchi [more than
one hundred and fifty out of five hundred] showed this spectrum. The
third type includes Antares, Alpha of Orion, and Alpha of Hercules,
Beta of Pegasus, Mira, and most of the stars shining with a red light.
The spectra show bands of lines; according to Secchi, there are shaded
bands, but a more powerful spectroscope shows multitudes of fine lines.
The spectra resemble somewhat the <i>spectrum of a sun-spot</i>, and
Secchi has advanced the theory that these stars are covered in great
part by spots like those of the sun. About one hundred [out of five
hundred] of the observed stars belong to this type.&rdquo; (It should
be noted that the presence of sun-spots is no evidence of diminished
heat in a sun; see Professor Proctor in his &ldquo;Myths and Marvels of
Astronomy,&rdquo; article &ldquo;Suns in Flames:&rdquo; &ldquo;It may
be noticed, in passing, that it is by no means certain that the time
when the sun is most spotted is the time when he gives out least
light&#8202;&hellip;. All the evidence we have tends to show that when
the sun is most spotted his energies are most active. It is then that

fourth type differs from the preceding in the arrangement and
appearance of the bands. It includes only faint stars. A few stars, as
Gamma of Cassiopeia, Eta of Argus, Beta of Lyra, etc., show the
<i>lines of hydrogen bright instead of dark</i>, as though surrounded
by hydrogen glowing with a heat more intense than that of the central
orb itself around which the hydrogen exists.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>All the above five hundred stars reveal the presence of hydrogen
under precisely such conditions as conform to the general principle
involved in the source and mode of solar energy as herein stated. But a
single star (Betelgeuse) was observed by Huggins and Miller in England
which showed the lines of sodium, magnesium, iron, bismuth, and
calcium, &ldquo;but found those of hydrogen wanting.&rdquo; Of the
spectrum of this gas, Professor Ball says, &ldquo;The hydrogen spectrum
appears to present a simplicity not found in the spectrum of any other
gas, and therefore it is with great interest that we examine the
spectra of the white stars, in which <i>the dark lines of hydrogen</i>
are unusually strong and broad.&rdquo; Referring to the new star in the
Northern Crown, which burst forth in 1866, the same writer says,
&ldquo;The feature which made the spectrum of the new star essentially
distinct from that of any other star that had been previously observed
was the presence of <i>certain bright lines</i> superposed on a
spectrum with dark lines of one of the ordinary types. The position of
certain of <i>these lines showed that one of the luminous gases must be
hydrogen</i>.&rdquo; Of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href=
"#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>this particular star (Betelgeuse)
it is said (Proctor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Familiar Essays&rdquo;), &ldquo;Red
stars and variable stars affect the neighborhood of the Milky Way or of
well-marked star-streams. The constellation Orion is singularly rich in
objects of this class. It is here that the strange
&lsquo;variable&rsquo; Betelgeuse lies. At present this star shows no
sign of variation, but a few years ago it exhibited remarkable
changes.&rdquo; We thus see that Betelgeuse is a variable star, and it
must have passed in its different variations between the limits of
extreme brilliancy, in which the lines of hydrogen appear bright, and
that of a less brilliant stage, in which they appear dark,&mdash;that
is, as absorption bands. It has thus, in fact, run the gamut, so to
speak, of color changes, and now occupies an intermediate position in
the scale. In his article &ldquo;Star unto Star,&rdquo; the same writer
says, &ldquo;On this view we may fairly assume that the darkness of the
hydrogen lines is a characteristic of stars at a much higher
temperature than our sun and suns of the same class.&rdquo; We have
already seen that the spectra of stars of the fourth
type&mdash;Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia, &ldquo;Spectrum
Analysis&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;show the lines of hydrogen bright instead
of dark, as though surrounded by hydrogen glowing with a heat more
intense than that of the central orb itself.&rdquo; Professor Dunkin
says, in his work &ldquo;The Midnight Sky,&rdquo; &ldquo;One of the
conclusions drawn by Kirchhoff from these experiments is that each
incandescent gas <i>weakens</i>, by absorption, rays of the same degree
of refrangibility as those it emits; or, in other words, that the
spectrum of each incandescent gas <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>is reversed when this gas is
traversed by rays of the same refrangibility emanating from an
intensely luminous source which gives of itself a continuous spectrum
like that of the sun.&rdquo; &hellip; &ldquo;The third division,
including Betelgeuse, Antares, Alpha Herculis, and others of like
color, seems to be affected by something peculiar in their physical
composition, <i>as if their photospheres contained a quantity of gas at
a lower temperature than usual</i>. The stars in this class have
generally a ruddy tint, probably owing to their light having undergone
some modification while passing through an absorbing
atmosphere&#8202;&hellip;. A great number of the stars in the third
division are variable in their lustre.&rdquo; We may therefore readily
conclude that midway between the inverted lines which constitute the
dark absorption bands and the faint spectra which show the bright lines
of hydrogen direct there must be an atmosphere of glowing hydrogen
superposed upon a deeper one in such proportion that it will
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>not reveal its presence in the spectroscope at
all; for when the dark and light bands, which occupy precisely the same
position in the spectrum, are of approximately equal intensity the
result will obviously be the neutralization of both. That among a
myriad suns, some with dark hydrogen lines and some with bright, there
should occur occasionally an example corresponding to this point of
divergence, and especially among variable stars, is not only to be
expected, but is, in fact, confirmatory of the general hypothesis
itself. It is an exception which emphatically proves the rule, when we
can trace the operative cause which has produced it. <span class=

<h2 class="main">THE PHENOMENA OF THE STARS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us now consider the phenomena of the double stars.
These were formerly believed to be single orbs, but the more powerful
telescopes of recent years have shown them to consist of two suns, each
substantially similar to our own sun, revolving around each other at a
relatively small distance apart. In Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia,
article &ldquo;Star,&rdquo; we read, &ldquo;It is noteworthy that few
simple stars show such colors as blue, green, violet, or indigo; but
among double and multiple star systems not only are these colors
recognized, but such colors as lilac, olive, gray, russet, and so on. A
beautiful feature in many double stars remains to be noticed: it is
often found that the components exhibit complementary colors. <i>This
is oftener seen among unequal doubles</i>, and then the larger
component shows a color from the red end of the spectrum, as red,
orange, or yellow, while the smaller shows the corresponding color from
the blue end, as green, blue, or purple. The colors are real, not
merely the result of contrast, for when the larger star is concealed
the color of the smaller remains (in most cases) unchanged. Spectrum
analysis shows that the colors of many double stars are due to the
absorptive vapors cutting off certain portions of the
light&#8202;&hellip;. The components <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>are circling around
each other, or rather around their common center of gravity.&rdquo;
Professor Ball, in his work &ldquo;In the High Heavens,&rdquo; says,
&ldquo;There is no more pleasing phenomenon in sidereal astronomy than
that presented by the contrasted hues often exhibited by double
stars&#8202;&hellip;. It seemed not at all impossible that there might
be some optical explanation of colors so vividly contrasted emanating
from points so contiguous. It was also remembered that blue stars were
generally only present as one member of an associated
pair&#8202;&hellip;. When, however, Dr. Huggins showed that the actual
spectrum of the object demonstrated that the cause of the color in each
star arose from absorption by its peculiar atmosphere, it became
impossible to doubt the reality of the phenomena. Since then it has
been for physicists to explain why two closely neighboring stars should
differ so widely <i>in their atmospheric constituents</i>, for it can
be no longer contended that their beautiful hues arise from an optical
illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of these double stars with complementary colors we quote the
following from Professor Dunkin (who, in turn, quotes from Admiral
Smyth, the author of &ldquo;Sidereal Chromatics&rdquo;): &ldquo;In Eta
Cassiopei&aelig; the large star is a dull white and the smaller one
lilac; in Gamma Andromed&aelig;, a deep yellow and sea-green; in Iota
Cancri, a dusky orange and a sapphire blue; in Delta Corvi, a bright
yellow and purple; and in Albiero, or Beta Cygni, yellow and blue. In
most of the remaining stars of the list the contrasting colors are
equally marked, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164"
name="pb164">164</a>]</span>also in many others which are not included
in it.&rdquo; Some of these double stars are variable in their colors,
as are the ordinary single variables, and, of course, for a similar
reason,&mdash;to wit, the varying intensity of more or less cumulative
planetary impacts.</p>

Systems.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The interpretation, of course, as explained below, is that these
suns, each one of different mass and consequently of different
electrical resistance, are arranged in parallel circuit along a single
line of electric current; a pair of different-sized arc or incandescent
lamps, similarly arranged, would exhibit precisely the same phenomena.
A compound solar system of this sort, apparently, with double sun and
single planetary system in process of formation, nearly completed from
a spiral nebula, is shown in a gaseous nebula within the constellation
Ursa Minor, illustrated in Lord Rosse&rsquo;s drawing (see Nichols
&ldquo;Architecture of the Heavens,&rdquo; Plate X., lower figure).</p>
<p>More than three thousand of these binary stars have been catalogued,
and some of them make a complete revolution about their common centers
of gravity&mdash;so distant are they from each other&mdash;in periods
of not less than sixty, or even eighty, years. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>Of
the double star Mizar,&mdash;the middle one of the three which form the
tail of the Great Bear,&mdash;Professor Ball states that, by new
methods of spectroscopic analysis, the component stars which form this
double have been found to be one hundred and fifty millions of miles
apart, while Alcor, a smaller star, visible to the naked eye, and
enormously farther from Mizar than are the components of the latter
from each other, moves through space in a parallel direction and with
the same velocity as its double companion. What the connection may be,
if any, we do not know, but their identical course is obviously related
to some common circumstance of origin, as is the probable case with
those other groups of stars which drift through space together. They
show that solar systems are not necessarily individual creations, but
may be formed in groups at the same period of time, and by the
operation of natural laws simultaneously directed upon or into the
creative matter from which solar systems are built up and sent along
their way. It has been already shown that our sun has a motion around
the center of gravity of our own solar system, as a whole, similar to
that of the binary stars around each other, but that, by reason of his
vast relative mass (seven hundred and fifty to one for all the
planets), this center is always within the confines of his own volume.
If, however, our sun were divided into two suns one, two, or five
million miles apart, each revolving around a common center of gravity
situated between the two, and the planets revolving around the same
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>center of gravity, but relatively more distant,
the planets would thus rotate around both suns as a common center, and
with the electric polarity of both suns the same, as must necessarily
be the case, they would present phenomena precisely similar to those
exhibited by the double stars. And such might very easily be the case
in even a system so small as our own, for the planet Mercury has so
elliptical an orbit that its distance from the sun varies in different
parts of its annual movement from twenty-eight to forty-five millions
of miles. There would then be mutual electric repulsion of the two
solar electrospheres, such as we see in the case of comets and in the
sun&rsquo;s corona and long streamers. Professor Proctor, article
&ldquo;The Sun&rsquo;s Long Streamers,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;These
singular appendages, like the streamers seen by Professor Abbe, extend
directly from the sun, as if he exerted some repellent
action&#8202;&hellip;. I cannot but think that the true explanation of
these streamers, whatever it may be (I am not in the least prepared to
say what it is), will be found whensoever astronomers have found an
explanation of comets&rsquo; tails&#8202;&hellip;. Whether the
repulsive force is electrical, magnetic, or otherwise, does not at
present concern us, or rather does concern us, but at present we are
quite unable to answer the question.&rdquo; A similar example is to be
found in the self-repellent positive electrospheres of the earth and
moon, illustrated on a previous page, which, in fact, are types among
planets of precisely what we find in double stars. Now, if these double
central suns, with a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>common system of planets revolving around
them both, differ one from the other in size, they will differ also in
the depth and density of their hydrogen atmospheres, and the electric
forces directed against them will produce different results in each. In
one we will have high temperature, great volatilization, and wide
absorption bands; in the other, a shallow atmosphere, a temperature
below that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>of an extensive volatilization of its metallic
components, and a spectrum rich in light at the blue end, while the
former one will be correspondingly richer in the yellow and red rays at
the opposite and lower end of the spectrum. One, in fact, will manifest
the phenomena of blue-white stars, the other, those of orange-red, but
variously modified in a chromatic series. The case may be extended to
multiple stars, and complementary colors, more or less perfect, may be
almost predicated as the law of compound solar bodies having cores like
that of our sun, but each of different mass, and surrounded by hydrogen
atmospheres of different depths and densities, both acted upon by the
same exterior planetary electrical currents. It is certainly true of
double stars, and probably so of all the others. Of course such
enormously massive double suns presuppose enormous planets, rotating
around them at enormous distances; but when we compare the distance of
our own satellite, the moon, from the earth with the distance of
Neptune from the sun, and consider that the light of the sun will reach
Neptune in about four hours, and then compare this distance with the
inconceivable distances of space requisite to retard and merge all
radiant energy into the diffused molecular energy of position, our
wonder will cease.</p>

</div>
<p>We have also to consider those single stars which (see
Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia, article &ldquo;Star&rdquo;) are
variable in their brilliancy. &ldquo;These stars may be divided into
periodic variables, irregular variables, and temporary stars. Periodic
variable stars <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>are those which undergo increase and diminution
of light at regular intervals. Thus, the star Mira, or Omicron of
Cetus, varies in lustre, in a period of three hundred and thirty-one
and one-third days, from the second magnitude to a faintness such that
the star can only be seen with a powerful telescope, and thence to the
second magnitude again. It shines for about a fortnight as a star of
the second magnitude, and then remains invisible for five months, the
<i>decrease</i> of lustre occupying about three months, the
<i>increase</i> about seven weeks. Such is the general course of its
phases. It does not always, however, return to the same degree of
brightness, nor increase and diminish by the same gradations; neither
are the successive intervals of its maxima equal. From recent
observations and inquiries into its history, the mean period would
appear to be subject to a cyclical fluctuation embracing eighty-eight
such periods, and having the effect of gradually lengthening and
shortening alternately those intervals to the extent of twenty-five
days one way and the other. The irregularities in the degree of
brightness attained at the maximum are probably also
periodical&#8202;&hellip;. It suggests a probable explanation of these
changes of brightness, that when the star is near its minimum, its
color changes from white to a full red, which, from what we know of the
spectra of colored stars, seems to indicate that the loss of brightness
is due to the formation of many spots over the surface of this distant
sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Algol is another remarkable variable, passing, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>however, much more rapidly through all its
changes. It is ordinarily a second-magnitude star, but during about
seven hours in each period of sixty-nine hours its lustre first
diminishes until the star is reduced to a fourth magnitude, and after
it has remained twenty minutes at its minimum its lustre is gradually
restored. It remains a second-magnitude star for about sixty-two hours
in each period of sixty-nine hours. These changes seem to correspond to
what might be expected if a large opaque orb is circling around this
distant sun in a period of sixty-nine hours, transiting its disk at
regular intervals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this star, Professor Ball says, &ldquo;Applying the improved
spectroscopic process to Algol, he [Vogel] determined on one night that
Algol was retreating from the earth at a speed of twenty-six miles per
second&#8202;&hellip;. When Vogel came to repeat his observations, he
found that Algol was again moving with the same velocity, but this time
towards the earth instead of from it&#8202;&hellip;. It appeared that
the movements were strictly periodic; that is to say, for one day and
ten hours the star is moving towards us, and then for a like time it
moves from us, the maximum speed being &hellip; twenty-six miles a
second&#8202;&hellip;. It is invariably found that every time the
movement of retreat is concluded the star loses its brilliance, and
regains it again at the commencement of the return
movement&#8202;&hellip;. The spectroscopic evidence admits of no other
interpretation save that there must be another mighty body in the
immediate vicinity of Algol&#8202;&hellip;. Algol must <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>be
attended by a companion star which, if not absolutely as devoid of
intrinsic light as the earth or the moon, is nevertheless dark
relatively to Algol. Once in each period of revolution this obscure
body intrudes itself between the earth and Algol, cutting off a portion
of the direct light from the star and thus producing the well-known
effect.&rdquo; This is, in fact, a periodic transit or eclipse of Algol
by a planet, such as we see in eclipses of our own sun by the moon and
the inner planets, except that Algol&rsquo;s planet is apparently
single like our moon with reference to the earth, and that it is
relatively much larger than any of our own planets, as we would
necessarily suppose it to be, if solitary. Its mass has been computed
by the effects which it produces, and we learn that it is not a dark
sun with a brilliant planet, but a brilliant sun with a dark planet,
just as our solar system presents. &ldquo;Algol, at the moment of its
greatest eclipse, has lost about three-fifths of its light; it
therefore follows that the dark satellite must have covered
three-fifths of the bright surface&#8202;&hellip;. The period of
maximum obscuration is about twenty minutes, and we know the velocity
of the bright star, which, along with the period of revolution, gives
the magnitude of the orbit.&rdquo; From these data it has been computed
that the globe of Algol itself is about one-fourth larger than that of
our visible sun, but its mass is so much less that its weight is only
one-half that of our sun, so that its body is probably gaseous. The
author concludes, &ldquo;No one, however, will be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>likely to doubt that it is the law of
gravitation, pure and simple, which prevails in the celestial spaces,
and consequently we are able to make use of it to explain the
circumstances attending the movements of Algol&rsquo;s dark companion.
<i>This body is the smaller of the two</i>, and the speed with which it
moves is double as great as that of Algol, so that it travels over as
many miles in a second as an express train can get over in an hour. The
companion of Algol is about the same size as our sun, but has a mass
only one-fourth as great. This indicates a globe of matter which must
be <i>largely in the gaseous state</i>, but which, <i>nevertheless,
seems to be devoid of intrinsic luminosity</i>. Their distance [apart]
is always some three million miles. This is, however, an unusually
short distance when compared with the dimensions of the two globes
themselves.&rdquo; With this exception, the author says, &ldquo;the
movements of Algol and its companion are not very dissimilar to
movements in the solar system with which we are already
familiar.&rdquo; It will be seen that the want of luminosity in the
dark companion of Algol finds a ready explanation in the fact that it
is a planet, acting precisely as our own planets do, and that the
luminosity of Algol itself is directly attributable to the electricity
developed by the presence of this planet rotating axially and orbitally
around it, and the darkness of the planet itself is the necessary
correlative of the heat and light of its sun. The planet has about
one-half the density of Saturn, while Algol has one-half the density of
the sun, and hence we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href=
"#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>should expect to find on Algol an
atmosphere largely composed of glowing hydrogen, and on its planet an
atmosphere largely composed of oxygen, in which, doubtless, float
enormous clouds of aqueous vapor. The interpretation is direct and
conclusive, and upon no other hypothesis can the facts be explained,
for their close connection with each other demonstrates their common
origin, and their masses are not so different one from the other as to
permit, on any theory of their coequal origin as suns, one to glow with
the fires of youth and energy and the other to have grown dark and dead
from old age and exhaustion, and especially so if still in its gaseous
stage, which is that which must characterize its highest state of
incandescent energy from the most active condensation of its volume, if
the nebular hypothesis has any validity whatever. In fact, this example
alone, if the constitution of Algol&rsquo;s dark satellite is really
gaseous, must go very far to throw the gravest doubt, in itself, on the
validity of this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The star Beta, of the constellation Lyra, has a full period of
twelve days and twenty-two hours, divided into two periods of six days
and eleven hours, in each of which the star has a maximum brightness of
about the three and one-half magnitude, but in one period the minimum
is about the four and one-third magnitude, while in the other it is
about the four and one-half magnitude. This peculiarity points, it is
said, to an opaque orb with a satellite, the satellite being occulted
by the primary in the alternative transits, and therefore the loss of
light is less. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span></p>
<p>The star Delta of Cepheus is quite different, however, for, while it
takes only one, day and fourteen hours in passing from its minimum to
maximum of brightness, it occupies three days and nineteen hours, or
somewhat more than double this time, in passing from maximum to
minimum. Two or three hundred of these variable stars are already
known. The above examples are cited in detail because they furnish the
strongest possible proof of the truth of the hypothesis which we are
endeavoring to present. While the movements of the stars Algol and Beta
Lyr&aelig; may find an adequate interpretation in the one case in a
large occulting planet, and in the other in an occulting planet with a
satellite, it is obvious that Mira and Delta Cephei cannot be explained
except by the presence of planetary bodies or satellites which do not
<i>mechanically</i> occult the light of their suns. In these regularly
variable stars it is the light which varies, but of course the solar
heat must vary also,&mdash;that is to say, the solar energy varies
regularly, but with unequal periods of growth and decline and with
larger periods of cyclical variation in addition. Such variations can
only be produced by the action of permanently connected and orbitally
rotating planetary bodies, acting <i>dynamically</i> through space, to
regularly increase and diminish the solar energy, and such bodies can
only do this by their orbital positions with reference to each other
and to the central sun itself. In this case, since the activity of
solar energy is most unquestionably varied by the planetary energies,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>by their position and movements, at least a
portion of solar energy <i>must</i> be due to planetary action, and if
this be so, it may be affirmed with certainty that substantially all
solar energy may be produced in the same way; for, otherwise, we seek
for two diverse causes to produce a single effect, which may be
produced by one. We have no knowledge, however, of any planetary energy
which could operate to increase or diminish the energy of the central
sun in its emission of light, except that which we have already
presented, and no theory of our own sun&rsquo;s energy hitherto
advanced has ever taken cognizance of the planetary energies of our
system as an effective cause for those of the sun. But while the
sun&rsquo;s energy is&mdash;as it must be in this case&mdash;the
outcome of that of the planets, it is equally obvious that the planets
themselves can have no permanent, inherent energy of their own to
generate or modify such energy of the sun, since they are in fact
supplied by the solar energy, and their motions are controlled and
regulated by the sun itself. Hence the inference is irresistible that
the planets must derive their primary force from an external source not
solar, and this they can only do by means of their rotation in space,
and the only force derivable from space of which we have any knowledge
is electricity, so that the circle thus becomes complete. How now shall
we explain these periodical aberrations of energy? The color of a star,
as we know, is no criterion of its age or size. The color is due to
atmospheric absorption of the radiant light. The double stars, for
example, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>revolve around each other at regular periods,
and they are necessarily of nearly the same age, as sidereal ages are
computed, but they frequently differ one from the other in color, and
multiple stars may be all different each from the others; and the
color, as before stated, is no criterion of size, for a small sun, with
its glowing hydrogen in a state of high incandescence, and with few
absorption bands in its spectrum, will appear bluish-white, or of that
specific type of stars, without reference to size, while a much larger
sun, with its light darkened by broad absorption bands and sun-spots,
will appear orange or red; and, consequently, difference of color can
be no criterion of distance, since a blue-white star of small size will
outshine a red orb of much greater magnitude, whether it be more or
less distant. The variable stars, for these reasons, belong to the
order of red stars mostly, if not altogether. We must also bear in mind
that sun-spots do not diminish the solar heat, as they are the result
of increased and not of diminished energy. Electric currents of high
potential pass directly, as we know, along the lines of least
resistance to their opposite center of polarity, so that two planets
nearly in conjunction with each other transmit their currents almost
directly towards the sun&rsquo;s center, and upon the same point of
solar latitude, while, if at right angles with the sun, they must
deliver their electricity along converging lines and thus strike the
solar surface at different points. Currents of electricity of high
potential also (see &ldquo;Electricity in the Service of Man,&rdquo;
page 75), by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>their own passage, facilitate the passage of
succeeding currents, so that generators discharging along the same
lines find less and less resistance. It is true that we find no
appreciable resistance in the passage of these currents between the
earth and the sun, as their velocity is that of light, but both light
and electricity may be equally retarded by resistance in a small
degree. We know also that in the condensed hydrogen atmosphere of the
sun there must be resistance, and also that the resistance in fluids
diminishes as the temperature rises. Considering now the variable star
Mira, as above described, we observe, as is the case with Delta Cephei,
also cited, that the period between its greatest light, in a descending
scale, and its least is about twice as long as its rise from minimum to
maximum. During a period of four years (1672 to 1676) it is said that
it was not visible at all.</p>

equal in size, and having a rotation about the sun in nearly eleven

these, a much more distant large planet, something like our Jupiter,
with an orbital period of many years, so that the cycle of relative
positions is complete in about eighty-eight of the shorter periods of
variation, we would have such results as we see in Mira. Twice in each
revolution of the double planet its two members and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=

have great brilliancy and whiteness until the metallic elements began
to volatilize in increased proportions; then an era of wide absorption
bands and redness, gradually increasing to a maximum after its periods
of greatest light, and then slowly diminishing as the double planet
advanced in its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179"
name="pb179">179</a>]</span>rotation; and, finally, as it again
approached conjunction, the brilliant hydrogen illumination,
subsequently followed by the gradually darkened spectrum, and so on,
while the large outer planet by its various positions would first
relatively retard and then accelerate the variation until its grand
cycle was complete. The permanent disappearance for years, if true, may
be due to other causes, which will be referred to in considering the
phenomena of new and temporary stars. Many of the irregular variables
may doubtless be similarly explained,&mdash;our own sun, in fact, being
a variable with a period of about eleven years,&mdash;and doubtless the
apparent irregularity in most cases is due to lack of sufficient time
for observation. Those stars which are in fact really irregular in
their variation owe their changes, doubtless, to the same causes which
produce new stars, so called, and &ldquo;suns in flames,&rdquo; which
will be next considered.</p>
<p>Among the countless stars of heaven a great catastrophe seems
occasionally to occur. A star bursts out into sudden flame, to all
appearance, or a great fixed star appears where no star had ever been
seen before. In Professor Proctor&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;Suns in
Flames&rdquo; (&ldquo;Myths and Marvels of Astronomy&rdquo;), we will
find an extended discussion of these wonderful phenomena. The
astronomer Tycho Brahe described the one which appeared in 1572 as
follows: &ldquo;It suddenly shone forth in the constellation Cassiopeia
with a splendor exceeding that of stars of the first magnitude, or even
Jupiter or Venus at their brightest, and could be seen by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>the
naked eye on the meridian at full day. Its brilliancy gradually
diminished from the time of its first appearance, and at the end of
sixteen months it entirely disappeared, and has never been seen since.
During the whole time of its apparition its place in the heavens
remained unaltered, and it had no annual parallax, so that its distance
was of the same order as that of the fixed stars.&rdquo; Tycho
described its changes of color as follows: first, as having been of a
bright white; afterwards of a reddish-yellow, like Mars or Aldebaran;
and, lastly, of a leaden white, like Saturn. In 1604 a first-magnitude
star suddenly appeared in the right foot of Ophiucus. &ldquo;It
presented appearances resembling those shown by the former, and
disappeared after a few months.&rdquo; Many other cases are cited by
astronomers, and in 1866 &ldquo;a star appeared in the Northern Crown,
the observations of which threw great light on the subject of so-called
new stars. In the first place, it was found that where this new star
appeared there had been a tenth-magnitude star; the new star, then, was
in reality a <i>star long known, which had acquired new brilliancy</i>.
&ldquo;When first observed with this abnormal lustre, it was shining as
a star of the second magnitude. Examined with the spectroscope, its
light revealed a startling state of things in those remote depths of
space. The usual stellar spectrum, rainbow-tinted and crossed by dark
lines, <i>was seen to be crossed also by four exceedingly bright lines,
the spectrum of glowing hydrogen</i>&hellip;. The greater part of the
star&rsquo;s light manifestly came from this glowing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>hydrogen, though it can scarcely be doubted that
the rest of the spectrum was brighter than before the outburst, the
materials of the star being raised to an intense heat. The maximum
brightness exceeded that of a tenth-magnitude star nearly eight hundred
times. After shining for a short time as a second-magnitude star, it
diminished rapidly in lustre, and it is now between the ninth and tenth
magnitudes&rdquo; (Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia). Of this new
star, Professor Ball says, &ldquo;Another memorable achievement in the
early part of Dr. Huggins&rsquo;s career is connected with the
celebrated new star that burst forth in the Crown in 1866. It seemed a
fortunate coincidence that just at the moment when the spectroscope was
beginning to be applied to the sidereal heavens a star of such
marvellous character should have presented itself&#8202;&hellip;. The
feature which made the spectrum of the new star essentially distinct
from that of any other star that had been previously observed was the
presence of certain bright lines superposed on a spectrum with dark
lines of one of the ordinary types. The position of certain of these
lines showed that one of the luminous gases must be
hydrogen&#8202;&hellip;. The spectroscope showed that there must have
been something which we may describe as a conflagration of hydrogen on
a stupendous scale, and this outburst would account for the sudden
increase in luminosity of the star, and also to some extent explain how
so stupendous an illumination, once kindled, could dwindle away in so
short a time as a few days.&rdquo; It will be seen that these new stars
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>leap suddenly into great brilliancy: it is a
matter of a few hours only. After remaining a very short time in this
stage of abnormal incandescence, they gradually die out again in lustre
and revert <i>to their original condition</i>; they are not consumed
either in body or atmosphere.</p>
<p>Several theories have been advanced to account for these remarkable
phenomena; see &ldquo;Suns in Flames,&rdquo; by Professor Proctor. One
is, in effect, that by some sudden &ldquo;internal convulsion a large
volume of hydrogen and other gases was evolved from it, the hydrogen by
its combination with some other element giving out the lines
represented by the bright lines, and at the same time heating to a
point of vivid incandescence the solid matter of the star&rsquo;s
surface&#8202;&hellip;. As the liberated hydrogen gas became exhausted
the flame gradually abated, and with the consequent cooling the
star&rsquo;s surface became less vivid and the star <i>returned to its
original condition</i>;&rdquo; which, by the way, it never could have
done if its atmosphere had been exposed to such a disintegration,
without the construction of an entirely new atmosphere precisely
similar to the one just destroyed. The process would be one of simple
combustion. It requires the evolution of enormous volumes of hydrogen
from within the planet, and of other enormous volumes of something
else, by which to burn it up and yet not burn up the <i>original</i>
hydrogen envelope. This other element could not have previously existed
outside the solar body and contiguous thereto, or it would have burned
up the ordinary hydrogen envelope of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>sun long before, as
well as the metallic vapors floating therein. Both these mutually
hostile gases must have come from within, and this is manifestly
impossible, as we should thus have explosion and solar destruction, but
not combustion. There is no reason to believe that hydrogen, the
lightest of elements, could have remained occluded within the solar
mass, to the exclusion of the heavier metals, if disassociated, and if
held combined no such sudden liberation could occur. Besides, such
convulsion would be impossible in any sun at all resembling ours, as
any further liberation of gases from internal condensation must be due
to solar contraction, hence gradual, and not sudden. Moreover, such
liberation of hydrogen gas from within would show its spectrum loaded,
at its earliest eruption, with absorption bands; and, finally, the
convulsion presupposes as great an activity, and consequently as great
a difficulty, before the phenomenon as the phenomenon itself presents;
for such vast disturbance of mass would be more difficult to account
for, and require more energy to produce, than the results themselves.
Moreover, the whole mass of the star appeared to increase equally in
temperature, as shown by the spectrum, and, if produced by an internal
convulsion, this must have extended to, if not proceeded from, its
core; so that while the combustion of hydrogen might have ceased in a
very brief time, the intense heat of the solar mass could not have been
dissipated for thousands of years. It would, in fact, have disrupted
the whole orb. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another theory is that this vast incandescence was caused by the
&ldquo;violent precipitation of some mighty mass&mdash;perhaps a
planet&mdash;upon the globe of that remote sun, by which the momentum
of the falling mass would be changed into molecular motion; in other
words, into heat and light.&rdquo; This theory is no more plausible
than the other, since it fails to account for the enormous volume of
hydrogen, with bright lines, as a result of such contact; while
Professor Proctor very clearly shows that such contact would have been
preceded, necessarily, by repeated partial grazings, as the outside
body repeatedly passed in swifter and closer passage by the sun in its
gradually approaching orbital revolutions, and that the increase of
light and heat must have been measured by years instead of by hours.
The same difficulties exist in the supposed passage of the star through
nebul&aelig; or star clouds, of which Professor Proctor says, &ldquo;As
for the rush of a star through a nebulous mass, that is a theory which
would scarcely be entertained by any one acquainted with the enormous
distances separating them&#8202;&hellip;. All we certainly know
suggests that the distances separating them from each other are
comparable with those which separate star from star.&rdquo; In fact, no
tenable theory has been advanced which will cover the phenomena.
Professor Proctor describes a star which flamed out in 1876. At
midnight, November 24, a star of the third magnitude was noticed in the
constellation of the Swan; its light was very yellow; its brilliancy
rapidly faded. On December 2 it was equal <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>to a star of the
fifth magnitude only, and the color, which had been yellow, was now
greenish-blue. &ldquo;The star&rsquo;s spectrum at this time consisted
almost entirely of bright lines. December 5 he found three bright lines
of hydrogen, the strong double line of sodium, the triple line of
magnesium, and two other lines. One of these last seemed to agree
exactly in position with a bright line belonging to the corona seen
around the sun during total eclipse.&rdquo; The star afterwards faded
away gradually until quite invisible to the naked eye. It will be
noticed that none of the above elements&mdash;sodium, potassium, or
magnesium&mdash;are such as would combine with hydrogen to produce the
phenomena in question. Professor Proctor concludes, &ldquo;This
evidence seems to me to suggest that the intense heat which suddenly
affected this star had its origin from without.&rdquo; He suggests
possible meteoric flights; but meteoric stones themselves are separated
in space by enormous distances, and these, if converged in orbital
flight, would present the same phenomena of successive grazings as a
small planet approaching under like circumstances, and by their
gradually increasing incandescence we should certainly have other
elements visible in the spectroscope besides those observed. And these
meteoric bodies, if projected into the sun, would pass in a very brief
time through the hydrogen envelope, producing only local phenomena, so
that their first blow would be manifested in volatilization of the
outer portions of the mass and broad absorption bands, and consequent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>redness of the planet, exhibiting great heat,
but not great light. In such case the bright lines of hydrogen, if they
appeared at all, would only be visible as an after-consequence, and not
at the earliest moment of conflagration,&mdash;that is, the star might
grow from red to white, but by no possibility the reverse. It is,
however, characteristic of these new stars that their first flash, as
it were, is into the incandescence of directly glowing hydrogen, with
its bright lines, then through a series of gradually increasing
sun-spots, and finally a slow return to their original condition and
apparent magnitude. It is obviously a surface phenomenon of the solar
atmosphere, primarily, then followed by consequences involving only the
outer surface of the solar core, but with no observable permanent
change in the character or constitution of the mass of the sun itself.
These characteristics are invariable, and the sequence of phenomena is
the same in all the cases observed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">What, then, is the probable cause of these terrific
conflagrations, as they appear to us? Take an ordinary electric
induction machine,&mdash;a Holtz or a Wimshurst,&mdash;and, if the
surrounding air is moist, as we operate it we will find that the
results are poor, the sparks short and relatively few; but let us take
the machine into another room in which the atmosphere is dry and crisp.
A wondrous change will occur, and instead of a current which could
scarcely flash across a few inches of space, we will now have so great
an increase of energy that its tension will even cause the spark to
perforate and destroy the glass walls of the heavy Leyden jars in which
it is condensed. The vast realms of space, with their attenuated
vapors, are the field in which the planetary electric generators
operate, and into which, likewise, myriads of suns constantly pour
their light and heat. We may consider this space, according to the
popular view, to be uniform in constitution and density throughout all
its parts,&mdash;that it is, in fact, like a vast, silent, and
motionless dead sea. But this cannot possibly be true, any more than
throughout the vast compass of our own atmosphere; for while some parts
of space are peopled by millions of solar <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>systems, others, as
we can plainly see, so far as telescopic vision extends, are
comparatively vacant. Far more electricity is being abstracted (so to
speak) in some parts of space than in others, and far more heat and
light are being poured back to restore the equilibrium in some than in
others. We have already seen that the temperature at the exterior
surface of the terrestrial atmosphere is estimated to be more than two
hundred degrees higher than in the realms of open interplanetary space;
hence there must be currents,&mdash;currents of rotation like cyclones,
vortical currents like whirlwinds, currents of transmission like our
land- and sea-breezes and the trade-winds,&mdash;and, in fact, all
space must be in a state of constant displacement and replacement, and,
if visible, we should see it like a vast room filled with smoke, in
which currents of every shape and direction and of all velocities would
be manifest. Such currents could throw nebul&aelig; during their
condensation into rotation which could never rotate of their own
motion, or gather to centers of aggregation vast whirling clouds of
spatial matter, and in the spiral nebul&aelig; we may see many such
movements of rotation in apparent active progress. Of these we read in
Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia, &ldquo;They have the appearance of a
maelstrom of stellar matter, and are among the most interesting objects
in the heavens.&rdquo; In Professor Nichol&rsquo;s splendid work
(&ldquo;The Architecture of the Heavens,&rdquo; 1850) we may see
magnificent engravings of these wonderful phenomena, from the drawings
by Lord Rosse, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>and no one can study these figures without
realizing the presence of vast currents in space.</p>
<div class="figure floatLeft p189width" id="p189"><img src=

<p>In the great spiral nebula in the constellation <i>Canes
Venatici</i> (see illustration in Chapter XII.) we perceive that the
tail of the smaller nebula has been drawn into the outer convolution of
the great spiral, against the radial repulsion of the latter nebula, as
we can see by its curvature. This can only be due to a tremendous
inflowing current in space. Were the deflection due to gravity the
trend would be to the center and not to the outer convolution of the
larger nebula. Professor Nichol says, &ldquo;The spiral figure is
characteristic of an extensive class of galaxies.&rdquo; Not only in
the spiral, but in other forms of nebul&aelig; we may observe these
currents of space, so that we cannot fail to perceive that they exist,
and we should even conclude, <i>a priori</i>, that these must
exist.</p>
<p>In the elongated linear nebula in Sobieski&rsquo;s Crown,
illustrated above, its length is deflected into irregular curves
apparently due to counter-currents of space. These gaseous
nebul&aelig;, Flammarion says, &ldquo;appear like immense vaporous
clouds tossed about by some rough winds, pierced with deep rents, and
broken in jagged portions.&rdquo; It may be said generally that every
sun, as it drifts through <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href=
"#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>space, must leave a wake of
increased electric potential among the molecules which line its
pathway. Beyond the limits of every vortex extend radial or tangential,
polar or equatorial, streams of space, and these must extend without
limit until deflected or neutralized by other conditions. Throughout
all space, just as in our own atmosphere, but vastly more slowly, there
must be an infinitude of movements in every direction,&mdash;movements
in lines, circles, vortices, ellipses and irregular curvatures, and of
all possible varieties of mass and volume.</p>
<p>Suppose, now, a sailing vessel lighted with incandescent lamps, the
electrical currents for the support of which are derived from the
chemical action of sea-water on multiple pairs of suitable metallic
plates arranged to extend downward as a galvanic battery into the ocean
as the ship sails along, and that these plates, by the chemical action
of the sea-water at ordinary, temperatures, should furnish a sufficient
current to properly light the vessel. If the constancy of such current
depended on the average temperature of the sea-water, at, say, sixty
degrees Fahrenheit, we should find that, on suddenly crossing into the
Gulf Stream, with a temperature twenty degrees higher, the energy of
the battery would be rapidly increased and the lights would glow with
increased brilliancy until, on emerging from the Gulf Stream at its
opposite side, the original status would be gradually restored. If
these distant solar systems, in their drift through space, should
encounter a corresponding stream <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191"
href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>under an increased molecular
tension, more highly heated, for example, or charged with electrical
potential by the surrounding solar systems, or otherwise, we should
expect a similar result to ensue,&mdash;that the currents would be
increased suddenly, both in quantity and intensity, and all the
phenomena of &ldquo;blazing&rdquo; stars be revealed in the precise
order in which we see them. Professor Proctor seems to have had some
such idea of space vaguely in his mind when he says, in his
&ldquo;Familiar Essays,&rdquo; &ldquo;One is invited to believe that
the star may have been carried by its proper motions into regions where
there is a more uniform distribution of the material whence this orb
recruits its fires. It may be that, in the consideration of such causes
of variation affecting our sun in long-past ages, a more satisfactory
explanation than any yet obtained may be found of the problem
geologists found so perplexing,&mdash;the former existence of a
tropical climate in places within the temperate zone, or even near the
arctic regions. Sir John Herschel long since pointed to the variation
of the sun as a possible cause of such changes of climate.&rdquo; In
confirmation of the view that such changes may be due to the passage of
a solar system into or through such a &ldquo;Gulf Stream&rdquo; of
space, we quote the following from Professor Proctor&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Suns in Flames:&rdquo; &ldquo;It is noteworthy that all the
stars which have blazed out suddenly, except one, have appeared in a
particular region of the heavens,&mdash;the zone of the Milky Way (all,
too, in one-half of that zone). The single exception is the star in the
Northern Crown, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192"
name="pb192">192</a>]</span>and that star appeared in a region which I
have found to be connected with the Milky Way <i>by a well-marked
stream of stars</i>; not a stream of a few stars scattered here and
there, but a stream where thousands of stars are closely aggregated
together, though not quite so closely as to form a visible extension of
the Milky Way&#8202;&hellip;. Now, the Milky Way and the outlying
streams of stars connected with it seem to form a region of the stellar
universe where fashioning processes are still at work.&rdquo; In just
such regions of potential energy should we look for such currents in
space, as, on our own earth, the Gulf Stream and the trade-winds, as
well as cyclones and other atmospheric movements, find their origin
under precisely parallel circumstances,&mdash;to wit, the outpour upon
and direct precipitation of increased quantities of heat at the tropics
or other local centers of such development. The effects of such an
increase of quantity and potential in an electrical current are clearly
illustrated in the device previously referred to, in which electrolytic
decomposition was effected in a pail of water; we find it also in the
burning out of the brushes and commutators in dynamo-electric machines
and in telegraphic apparatus during thunder-storms and the like.
Allowing a solar system a drift through space only equal to that of our
own, which has a relatively slow movement, it would traverse such a
&ldquo;Gulf Stream&rdquo; of space seven hundred thousand miles wide in
a single day. But it may not even have passed through; it may merely
have grazed the margin of such a current; for the motions of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>solar systems are not controlled by the same
forces as those upon which their electrical energies depend.</p>
<p>Professor Ball, in his chapter on the great heat-wave of 1892, says,
&ldquo;Towards the end of July an extraordinarily high temperature,
even for that period of the year, prevailed over a very large part of
the North American continent. The so-called heat-wave then seems to
have travelled eastward and crossed the Atlantic Ocean; &hellip; a
fortnight after the occurrence of unusually great heat in the New World
there was a similar experience in the Old World&#8202;&hellip;. This
discussion will at all events enable us to make some reply to the
question which has often been asked, as to what was the cause of the
great heat-wave&#8202;&hellip;. It is, however, quite possible that
certain changes in progress on the sun may act in a specific manner on
our climate&#8202;&hellip;. It cannot be denied that local, if not
general, changes in the sun&rsquo;s temperature must be the
accompaniment of the violent disturbances by which our luminary is now
and then agitated. It is, indeed, well known that there are occasional
outbreaks of solar activity, and that these recur in a periodic manner;
it is accordingly not without interest to notice that the present year
has been one of the periods of this activity. We are certainly not
going so far as to say that any connection has been definitely
established between a season of exuberant sun-spots and a season
remarkable for excessive warmth; but, as we know that there is a
connection between the magnetic condition of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>earth and the state of solar activity, it is by
no means impossible that climate and sun-spots may also stand in some
relationship to each other.&rdquo; These local deviations are doubtless
due to planetary positions with reference to the sun, but more general
variations must depend upon the constitution of such parts of space as
the solar system may occupy; but even then they will be but temporary,
since the sun&rsquo;s volume will rapidly expand or contract so as
finally to restore the normal emission of solar heat, as will be
further explained later on in this work.</p>

line spectrum: 3, stage of recession, chromosphere diminishing in

</div>
<p>There are other causes also, readily conceivable, for such increased
electrical action; for instance, in that thickly-peopled region of
space, two solar systems adjacent might easily have their exterior
planets so related to each other as suddenly, at their points of
nearest approach, to cause one or more to direct an abnormally large
electrical current into the sun of the adjacent system; this would
correspond in electric energy, in fact, to a violent
&ldquo;perturbation&rdquo; in its orbit by the action of gravity
produced by a neighboring planet or system. No reversal of polarity
could take place between these planets under these circumstances, any
more than between the earth and the moon. In some portions of the Milky
Way, doubtless, suns blaze by dozens across the sky at night, and by
day as well, to which, in our more solitary skies, we are strangers.
Revolving in perfect harmony, perturbations must nevertheless be
frequent, and to what limits they may there be confined we shall
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>never know until we realize the extent of these
galaxies and the relative contiguity of their solar systems to each
other. It is enough to show how such variations may occur; in what
particular way they do occur does not affect the question of their
origin. Even if such increased energy were to continue by permanently
increased planetary action, it is not necessary to suppose that a
corresponding permanent increase of light and heat would result on the
part of the sun, for its density is such (only one-fourth that of the
earth) that, under the tremendous force of its gravity (twenty-seven
and one-tenth times that of the earth), its constituents cannot be
maintained in solid form, but must be, as before stated, either liquid
or gaseous, and perhaps in part both. Now, as it has been computed that
the sun, by contraction to its present density, would have evolved its
present light and heat for a period of millions of years, it is obvious
that any increase in its present volume, without increase of mass,
would produce precisely opposite and compensated results, so that the
sun could receive from outside sources as much heat as would expand its
present volume to that at the initial point of such assumed
condensation without increased emission of light and heat. The sun is
thus, in effect, a self-compensating machine, and its passage through a
region of increased electrical generation would first manifest itself
in a vast increase of brilliancy, due to higher incandescence of its
hydrogen envelope; this, in turn, would be communicated to the deeper
structures of the sun, producing increased volatilization <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>and
dark absorption bands, and finally to the whole solar mass, expanding
its volume in proportion to the heat absorbed. Hence we should see
precisely the phenomena that we do see in flaming stars or so-called
new stars. We find such compensations all through nature, and it is
simply in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>accordance with her universal laws that they
occur. It is a singular circumstance that the catastrophe which is
foretold in the biblical record as the termination of all human life on
earth, for the present cycle, at least, should be almost literally in
accordance with the phenomena characteristic of such an increase of
solar energy, and one produced in some such manner. If the temperature
of the solar atmosphere were rapidly raised by increased planetary
action to a point which would reverse the lines of hydrogen from dark
to bright, say to a brightness eight hundred times that of the normal,
as in the case of the temporary star cited, though the heat would not,
of course, be increased in any such proportion, yet the heavens would
be indeed rolled up as a scroll, and all life would be extinguished in
a very brief period. But the planets would continue to roll along their
orbits, the integrity of the earth&rsquo;s mass would still be intact,
and after a few days or weeks the sun would begin to decline in
brightness, the volatilized vapors would slowly recede within the solar
atmosphere, and the temperature would gradually fall again to its
normal, leaving, however, a lifeless world to roll on its way
henceforth, but as bright and cheerful in all its possibilities, when
the former conditions had gradually become restored, as before. Perhaps
some distant astronomer in the neighborhood of Sirius&mdash;if we shall
have travelled so far away by that time&mdash;might send a note to the
morning papers to announce that the temporary star near Alpha Centauri
had again receded to the tenth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198"
href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>magnitude. In due
time&mdash;perhaps a thousand years&mdash;all would be ready for a new
development of life, and the cycle would continue as before. Perchance,
too, in some deep abyss, or buried far beneath the surface, some germs
of life might still continue to exist; and from these, like the seeds
resurrected from buried mummies, a new life might again begin, guided
along once more through vast ages in a progressive ascent from
development to development until, in some new and strange forms, the
higher types of life might again appear. To these there would indeed be
revealed a new heaven and a new earth. Who knows how many such cycles
of life may have come and gone on earth, in which, like the dwellers of
Jerusalem, new peoples have built new cities, one above another, upon
the unknown graves of the past? In the words of Tennyson,&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">Whatever the coming, the progress, or the going of
life on earth, the course of our solar system will go on the same, the
processes of creation unchanged and her mechanism unimpaired. It is
obvious that no such conditions could prevail in the return to
unorganizable chaos which must be the consequence of any possible
planetary collisions in space. No conceivable process of creation could
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>return a system disrupted into meteorites to an
operative solar system again. Even the nebular hypothesis contemplates
nothing of that sort as, by the wildest conjecture, ever possible. But
with us the danger is far distant. Professor Proctor says, in his
article &ldquo;Suns in Flames,&rdquo; &ldquo;As Sir William Herschel
long since pointed out, we can recognize in various parts of the
heavens various stages of development, and chief among the regions
where as yet nature&rsquo;s work seems incomplete is the Galactic
zone,&mdash;especially that half of it where the Milky Way consists of
irregular streams and clouds of stellar light. As there is no reason
for believing that our sun belongs to this part of the galaxy, but, on
the contrary, good ground for considering that he belongs to the class
of insulated stars, few of which have shown signs of irregular
variation, while none have ever blazed suddenly out with many hundred
times their former lustre, we may fairly infer a very high degree of
probability in favor of the belief that, for many ages still to come,
the sun will continue steadily to discharge his duties as fire, light,
and life of the solar system.&rdquo; The passage of our system through
gradually changing regions of space, as contrasted with streams or
vortices, could not affect our sun&rsquo;s light even temporarily, as
the contraction and expansion of its volume would fully compensate for
any such gradual or partial variation, and, by position, he is far from
likely to pass into any of those whirlpools or torrents of space which
seem to mark at irregular intervals the region of the irregularly
variable stars. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200"
name="pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p>Allied in appearance to such stars which suddenly flame out in
space, but totally different in reality, are comets. These strangers to
our own system have excited the wonder and astonishment of mankind from
the earliest ages. They seem to defy all rules and all explanation;
but, when properly examined, they will fall inevitably into the general
scheme of the source and mode of solar energy which we have endeavored
to present. These bodies enter our solar system from without.
Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia says, &ldquo;Schiaparelli, to whom
the discovery is in part due, considers the meteors to be dispersed
portions of the comet&rsquo;s original substance,&mdash;that is, of the
substance with which <i>the comet entered the solar domain</i>.&rdquo;
Professor Proctor, &ldquo;Meteoric Astronomy,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;A
word or two may be permitted on the question of the condition of
<i>comets freshly arriving on the scene of the solar system</i>. It is
assumed sometimes that the train of meteors already exists when the
comet <i>first comes within the solar domain</i>.&rdquo; In the
&ldquo;Romance of Astronomy&rdquo; (R. Kalley Miller, M.A.) it is said,
&ldquo;In a sort of debatable territory between our own solar system
and the infinite stellar universe around we come upon these erratic and
anomalous bodies&mdash;the comets; some of which have accidentally
become permanent attendants upon our sun; others have only paid it a
single casual visit in the course of their wanderings through space,
and are not likely again to come within the range of its attracting
influence; while countless millions are doubtless scattered throughout
the realms of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201"
name="pb201">201</a>]</span>infinite, whose existence will never be
revealed to human ken at all.&rdquo; Professor Helmholtz, in fact (see
addendum to his lecture on the origin of the planetary system),
advanced the idea in a speculative way, that our terrestrial life might
have had its origin in one of these meteoric bodies by the
&ldquo;transmission of organisms through space.&rdquo; In Professor
Proctor&rsquo;s article on comets (&ldquo;Mysteries of Time and
Space&rdquo;) he says, &ldquo;The paths followed by comets show no
resemblance either to the planetary orbits or to each other. Here we
see a comet travelling in a path of moderate extent and not very
eccentric; then another which rushes from a distance of two or three
thousand millions of miles, approaches the sun with ever-increasing
velocity until nearer to him than parts of his own corona (as seen in
eclipses), sweeps around him with inconceivable rapidity, and makes off
again to where the aphelion of its orbit lies far out in space beyond
the most distant known planet,&mdash;Neptune. Some comets travel in a
direct, some in a retrograde path; a few near the plane of the
earth&rsquo;s orbit, many in planes showing every variety of
inclination. Some comets regularly return after intervals of a few
years; some after hundreds of years; others are only seen once or
twice, and then unaccountably vanish; and not a few show by the paths
they follow that they have come from interstellar space to pay our
system but a single visit, passing out again to traverse we know not
what other systems or regions&#8202;&hellip;. When we have said that
these objects obey the law of gravity, we have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>mentioned the only circumstance&mdash;as it
would appear&mdash;in which they conform to the relations observed in
terrestrial and planetary arrangements. And even this law&mdash;the
widest yet revealed to man&mdash;they seem to obey half unwillingly. We
see the head of a comet tracing out systematically enough its proper
orbit, while the comet&rsquo;s tail is all unruly and
disobedient&#8202;&hellip;. The fact, then, is demonstrated that two of
the meteor streams encountered by the earth are so far associated with
two comets as to travel on the same orbits. We may not unsafely infer
that all the meteor systems are in like manner associated with other
comets. Nor is it very rash to assume that all comets are in like
manner associated with meteor systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the influence of gravitation of the planets, the same
author says (&ldquo;Meteoric Astronomy&rdquo;), &ldquo;Now, the
circumstances under which a comet approaching the sun on a parabolic or
hyperbolic orbit can be thus affected must be regarded as exceptional.
The planet&rsquo;s influence must, in the first place, be very
energetically exercised; in other words, the arriving comet must pass
very close to the planet, for under any other circumstances the
sun&rsquo;s influence so enormously outvies the planet&rsquo;s that the
figure of the cometic orbit would be very little affected. Moreover,
the planet&rsquo;s attraction must produce an important balance of
retardation. The planet will inevitably accelerate the comet up to a
certain point, and afterwards will retard it; the latter influence must
greatly exceed the former. To show how greatly the comet must be
retarded, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>it is only necessary to mention that the actual
velocity of the November meteors when they cross the orbit of Uranus is
less than one-third of the velocity with which Uranus himself travels,
but their velocity at the same distance from the sun, when they were
approaching him from some distant stellar domain, exceeded the velocity
of Uranus in his orbit in the proportion of about seven to
five&#8202;&hellip;. It follows, not merely as a probable inference,
but, I think, as a demonstrated conclusion, that if the November
meteors came originally into our system as a comet travelling sunward
from infinity, then either that comet was very compact or else Uranus
captured only a small portion of the comet, the remaining portions
moving thenceforth on orbits wholly different from the path of the
November meteors&#8202;&hellip;. No other planet than Uranus can have
brought about the subjection of this comet to solar rule.&rdquo; In his
article on comets he says, &ldquo;It may be well here to consider a
case in which some active force (other than gravity) exerted by the sun
seems to have brought the destruction of a comet, or at least to have
broken up the comet into unrecognizable fragments.&rdquo; He refers to
Biela&rsquo;s comet, with an orbital period of six and two-thirds
years, and a path which was found to approach very near to the path of
the earth. In 1832 the comet crossed the earth&rsquo;s track several
weeks before the arrival of the earth at the same point without
appreciable interference. On its second return, in 1845&ndash;46, it
was found to be divided into two comets travelling side by side; in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>1852 they reappeared, still divided, and
gradually diverging from each other. Since then they have never
reappeared, though diligently sought for at every period. Professor
Proctor adds, &ldquo;It has been seen again, though not as a comet;
nay, the occasion on which it was seen in the way referred to was
predicted, and the prediction fulfilled, even in details. For a full
account of its reappearance&mdash;as a meteor stream&mdash;I refer the
reader to my essay on Biela&rsquo;s comet in &lsquo;Familiar Science
Studies.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Miller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Romance of Astronomy&rdquo; we read,
&ldquo;Encke&rsquo;s comet, which possesses the smallest orbit of any
connected with our system, is sensibly drawing nearer and nearer to the
sun at every revolution.&rdquo; In Professor Proctor&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cometic Mysteries,&rdquo; the author says, &ldquo;We hear it
stated that the nucleus of a comet is made up of meteoric stones
(Professor P. G. Tait says&mdash;for unknown reasons&mdash;that they
resemble &lsquo;paving stones or even bricks&rsquo;) as confidently as
though the earth had at some time passed through the nucleus of a
comet, and some of our streets were now paved with stones which had
fallen to the earth on such an occasion. As a matter of fact, all that
has yet been proved is that meteoric bodies follow in the track (which
is very different from the tail) of some known comets, and that
probably all comets are followed by trains of meteors. These may have
come out of the head or nucleus in some way as yet unexplained; but it
is by no means certain that they have done so, and it is by many
astronomers regarded as more than doubtful. The most important point to
be noticed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>in the behavior of large comets as they approach
the sun is, that usually the side of the coma which lies towards the
sun is the scene of intense disturbance. Streams of luminous matter
seem to rise continually towards the sun, attaining a certain distance
from the head, when, assuming a cloud-like appearance, they seem to
form an envelope around the nucleus. This envelope gradually increases
its distance from the sun, growing fainter and larger, while within it
the process is repeated and a new envelope is formed. This, in turn,
ascends from the nucleus, expanding as it does so, while within it a
new envelope is formed. Meanwhile the first one formed has grown
fainter, perhaps has disappeared. But sometimes the process goes on so
rapidly (a day or two sufficing for the formation of a complete new
envelope) that several envelopes will be seen at the same
time,&mdash;the outermost faintest, the innermost most irregular in
shape and most varied in brightness, while the envelope or envelopes
between are the best developed and most regular. The matter raised up
in these envelopes seems to have undergone a certain change of
character, causing it no longer to obey the sun&rsquo;s attractive
influence, but to experience a strong repulsive action from him,
whereby it is apparently swept away with great rapidity to form the
tail. &lsquo;It flows past the nucleus,&rsquo; says Dr. Huggins,
&lsquo;on all sides, still ever expanding and shooting backward until a
tail is formed in the direction opposite to the sun. This tail is
usually curved, though sometimes rays or extra tails sensibly straight
are also seen.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span></p>
<p>In &ldquo;The Sun as a Perpetual Machine,&rdquo; Professor Proctor
says, &ldquo;Take, again, the phenomena of comets, which still remain
among the greatest of nature&rsquo;s mysteries. We have reason to
believe &hellip; that the nucleus of a comet consists of an aggregation
of stones similar to meteorites. Adopting this view, and assuming that
these stones have absorbed somewhere gases to the amount of six times
their volume (taken at atmospheric pressure), we may ask, What will be
the effect of such a mass of stones advancing towards the sun at a
velocity reaching in perihelion the prodigious rate of three hundred
and sixty-six miles per second (as observed in the comet of 1843),
being twenty-three times our orbital rate of motion?&rdquo; Professor
Ball says, &ldquo;One of the most important results of the great shower
of 1866 was the demonstration that the swarm of little bodies to which
that shower owed its origin was connected with a comet. The swarm was
found, in fact, to follow the exact track which the comet pursued
around the sun&#8202;&hellip;. Of this connection between the cometary
orbits and revolving swarms of meteors many other instances could be
cited. I may refer to the remarkable lists published by the British
Association, in which, beside the name of the comet or the designation
which astronomers had affixed to it, the meteoric swarm with which the
comet is associated is also given&#8202;&hellip;. On these grounds it
appears to be perfectly certain that the origin of the shooting stars
which appear in swarms cannot be disassociated from the origin of the
comets by which those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>swarms are accompanied.&rdquo; The
author makes a distinction between such ordinary shooting stars and
meteorites, and attributes the appearance of the latter on earth to
masses thrown forth from some volcano <i>somewhere</i>, but this has
nothing to do with the special phenomena to be interpreted. It may be
said, however, that the presence of olefiant gas as one of the occluded
gases in a meteorite (four and fifty-five-hundredths per cent., as
stated by Professor Proctor, in his article &ldquo;The Sun as a
Perpetual Machine&rdquo;), and the remarkable fact, stated in the
article &ldquo;Spectrum Analysis&rdquo; in Appleton&rsquo;s
Cyclop&aelig;dia, that, in Winnecke&rsquo;s comet of 1868, &ldquo;the
bands agree in position with those obtained as the spectrum of carbon,
by passing the electric spark through olefiant gas, &ldquo;would lead
one to consider a cometic origin, for this particular meteorite at
least, to be highly probable. Professor Ball further says, &ldquo;There
have been several instances in which a comet has approached so close to
a planet that the attraction between the two bodies must have had
significant influence on the planet, if the cometary mass had been at
all comparable with that of the more robust body. The most celebrated
instance is presented in the case of Lexell&rsquo;s comet, which
happened to cross the track of Jupiter. The effect upon this body was
so overwhelming that it was wrenched from its original path and started
afresh along a wholly different track.&rdquo; The same writer, speaking
of the tails of comets, says, &ldquo;I have no intention to discuss
here the vexed question of the tails of comets. I do <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>not
now inquire whether the repulsion by which the tail is produced be due
to the intense radiation from the sun, or to electricity, or to some
other agent. It is sufficient for our present purpose to note that,
even if the tails of comets do gravitate towards the sun, the
attraction is obscured by a more powerful repulsive
force&#8202;&hellip;. Nor do the directions in which the comets move
exhibit any conformity; some move round the sun in one direction, some
move in the opposite direction. Even the planes which contain the
orbits of the comets are totally different from each other. Instead of
being inclined at only a very few degrees to their mean position, the
planes of the comets hardly follow any common law; they are inclined at
all sorts of directions. In no respect do the comets obey those
principles which are necessary to prevent constitutional disorder in
the planetary system&#8202;&hellip;. Now, all we have hitherto seen
with regard to comets tends to show that the masses of comets are
extremely small. Attempts have been made to measure them, but have
always failed, because the scales in which we have attempted to weigh
them have been too coarse to weigh anything of the almost spiritual
texture of a comet. It is unnecessary to go as far as some have done,
and to say that the weight of a large comet may be only a few pounds or
a few ounces. It might be more reasonable to suppose that the weight of
a large comet was thousands of tons, though even thousands of tons
would be far too small a weight to admit of being measured by the very
coarse <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>balance which is at our disposal.&rdquo; In the
chapter &ldquo;Visitors from the Sky,&rdquo; the same author says,
&ldquo;As such a comet in its progress across the heavens passes
between us and the stars, those stars are often seen twinkling
brilliantly right through the many thousand miles of cometary matter
which their rays have to traverse. The lightest haze in our atmosphere
would suffice to extinguish the faint gleam of these small stars;
indeed, a few feet of mist would have more power of obstructing the
stellar light than cometary material scores of thousands of miles
thick. It is true that the central portions of many of these comets
often exhibit much greater density than is found in the exterior
regions; still, in the great majority of such objects there is no
opacity, even in the densest part, sufficient to put out a star. In the
case of the more splendid bodies of this description, it may be
supposed that the matter is somewhat more densely aggregated as well as
more voluminous; still, however, it will be remembered that the great
comet of 1858 passed over Arcturus, and that the star was seen shining
brilliantly, notwithstanding the interposition of a cometary curtain
millions of miles in thickness. So far as I know, no case is known in
which the nucleus of a really bright and great comet has been witnessed
in the act of passage over a considerable star. It would indeed be
extremely interesting to ascertain whether in such case the star
experienced any considerable diminution in its lustre.&rdquo;

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From the extracts thus cited we may form a fairly
clear idea of the phenomena which comets present, and these facts
represent about all that we know of these mysterious objects. They
approach the sun in a nearly radial direction, thus cutting the
planetary orbits transversely. They approach the sun from all
directions and at all angles, without reference to the common plane in
which all the planetary orbits lie. They have no rotation on their own
axes, as the planets have, but, like an aggregated mass of meteorites
or cosmical dust, rush inward from the exterior realms of space, so
that their course is diametrically opposite that of the planets and the
other cosmical bodies which constitute our solar system. Such a body as
a comet, in fact, would present in its approach to our solar system
very much the phenomena of an approaching exterior sun, corresponding
far more closely in appearance and behavior to our own sun than to any
of the planets. Such a body could not generate positive electricity, as
the planets do, but, on the contrary, must have an electrosphere of
negative, or at least neutral, polarity. On its approach to our
planetary system the batteries of all the planets would be at once
turned upon the intruder, and it would be rapidly thrown into the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>same state of active electrical polarity as the
sun. The aqueous vapor condensed around its nucleus by gravity in its
approach through space, or buried among the meteoric particles
constituting the comet, would be necessarily decomposed into its
constituent gases, just as in the case of the sun, by the positive
electrical currents from the planetary electrospheres, and the
disassociated hydrogen would form the negative electrosphere of the
comet, glowing with its own luminosity, by gaseous incandescence.
&ldquo;We should then observe, during its continued approach to the
sun, phenomena similar to those which we might expect to manifest
themselves during the approach of a minute solar body towards the sun,
characterized by a rapid increase of velocity, due to attraction of
gravity, and tremendous mutual repulsion between the solar and cometic
electrospheres. We should see the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212"
href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>luminous hydrogen and
associated gases boiling upward, and thence drawn forward from the
nucleus by the combined gravity of the sun&rsquo;s mass, that of the
planetary masses, and the opposite polarity of the planetary
electrospheres, while they would be, at the same time, repelled
backward by the enormous repulsive force of the negative electrosphere
of the sun. As a result, we should find these gases in a state of
ebullition, forced forward under great excitement and disturbance,
boiling, eddying about, driven to and fro in all directions until the
sun&rsquo;s repulsive force had overcome the different attractions,
when these luminous clouds or envelopes would be swept swiftly off to
the rear, as by a powerful current of wind, around the margins of the
nucleus, and they would be seen to stream backward from the sun as an
elongated envelope or tail. New volumes of gas would pour to the front,
attracted from deeper depths, and these, on reaching the cometary
electrosphere, would be again repelled by the solar activity and driven
to the rear, while the gases thus driven backward, themselves similarly
electrified, would mutually repel each other as they streamed backward
around the margins of the nucleus.</p>

</div>
<p>Let us now see what these gases are: if they are such as appear in
the sun&rsquo;s electrosphere, we will know that such must be their
action; if, on the contrary, they are such as appear in planetary
electrospheres, we will find any such attempted explanation to be a
failure. Quoting largely from Dr. Huggins, Professor Proctor, in his
&ldquo;Cometic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>Mysteries,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;The spectrum of
the brightest comet of that year was partly continuous, and on this
continuous spectrum many of the well-known Fraunhofer lines could be
traced. This made it certain that part of the comet&rsquo;s light was
reflected sunlight, though Dr. Huggins considers also that a part of
the continuous spectrum of every comet is due to inherent light. On
this point some doubt may be permitted. It is one thing for special
bands to show themselves, for some substances may become self-luminous
under special conditions at very moderate temperatures; it is quite
another thing that the solid parts of a comet&rsquo;s substance should
become incandescent. I venture to express my opinion that this can
scarcely happen, except in the case of comets which approach very near
to the sun. Besides the continuous spectrum with dark lines, the
<i>photograph showed also a spectrum of bright lines</i>. &lsquo;These
lines,&rsquo; says Dr. Huggins, &lsquo;possessed extreme interest, for
there was certainly contained within this hieroglyphic writing some new
information. A discussion of the position of these new lines showed
them to be undoubtedly the same lines which appear in certain compounds
of carbon. Not long before Professors Liveing and Dewar had found from
their laboratory experiments that these lines are only present when
nitrogen is also present, and that they indicate a nitrogen compound of
carbon,&mdash;namely, cyanogen. <i>Two other bright groups were also
seen in the photograph, confirming the presence of
hydrogen</i>,&mdash;carbon and nitrogen.&rsquo; It is worthy of notice
that only a few <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214"
name="pb214">214</a>]</span>days later Dr. H. Draper succeeded in
obtaining a photograph of the same comet&rsquo;s spectrum. It appeared
to him to confirm Dr. Huggins&rsquo;s statements, except only that the
dark Fraunhofer lines were not visible, the photograph having probably
been taken under less favorable conditions&#8202;&hellip;. But the
latest comet has brought with it fresh news. Its spectrum is not like
that given by the comets we are considering. The bright lines of sodium
are seen in it, and also other bright lines and groups of lines which
have not yet been shown to be identical with any belonging to the
hydrocarbon groups, but probably are so&#8202;&hellip;. The cyanogen
groups are not seen&#8202;&hellip;. But it is manifest that <i>this
comet underwent important changes</i>&hellip;. In April was found
simply a faint continuous spectrum; in May the three bands associated
with carbon were present, though faint, while there was no trace
whatever of the sodium band. On the contrary, in June the nucleus of
the comet gave a very strong and extended continuous spectrum with an
excessively strong bright line in the orange-yellow identical with the
well-known double sodium line of the solar spectrum. On this &hellip;
it is necessary to conclude that during the last fortnight of May the
spectrum of Wells&rsquo;s comet had changed in a manner of which the
history of science furnishes no precedent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It should be observed that the elements carbon and hydrogen closely
resemble each other, not only in their multifarious chemical affinities
and reactions, but in their electric polarities, and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>hydrocarbon compounds, like their constituents,
carbon and hydrogen, are electrically similar to each other, an example
of this similarity of the elements being found in the identical action
of the carbon arc and hydrogen envelope in the heating and lighting
experiments with electrical currents hereinbefore described.</p>
<p>We have already seen that carbon follows quite a different law from
the other concrete elements, in the fact that its electrical resistance
diminishes as the temperature rises; it also differs widely from the
other solid elements in its <i>atomic heat</i>, which has a value much
less than one-half the mean constant, which is 6.4. Of this matter of
specific heat, Professor Fownes, in his work on chemistry
(Bridges&rsquo; edition), says, &ldquo;Dulong and Petit observed in the
course of their investigation a most remarkable circumstance. If the
specific heats of bodies be computed upon equal weights, numbers are
obtained all different and exhibiting no simple relations among
themselves; but if, instead of equal weights, quantities be taken in
the proportion of the atomic weights, an almost perfect coincidence in
the numbers will be observed, showing that some exceedingly intimate
connection must exist between the relations of bodies to heat and their
chemical nature; and when the circumstance is taken into view that
relations of even a still closer kind link together chemical and
electrical phenomena, it is not too much to expect that ere long some
law may be discovered far more general than any with which we are yet
acquainted&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href=
"#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>Nevertheless, this law must not be
understood as perfectly general, for there are three
elements&mdash;namely, carbon, boron, and silicon&rdquo; [these form a
single group of elements in chemical classification]&mdash;&ldquo;which
exhibit decided exceptions to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Organic chemistry is substantially based upon the almost infinitely
interchanging relations among carbon-hydrogen radicals, supplemented by
a few other elements. According to Professor Fownes, &ldquo;Organic
chemistry is in fact the chemistry of carbon compounds.&rdquo; The
position of carbon among the elements is something like that of camphor
among the oils, the latter being a volatile oil, but concrete in form.
With a concrete element having the peculiar character of carbon we can
well understand its universal chemical and electrical relationship with
gaseous hydrogen in the grandest operations of nature.</p>
<p>Cyanogen is an electrically similar compound of carbon with the
addition of nitrogen. Of these elements it will be seen that nitrogen
and hydrogen are found to exist also in the gaseous nebul&aelig;, and
<i>with the probable addition there of oxygen</i>; but in comets the
quota of active oxygen must be sought for in the correlated planetary,
and not in the cometic, atmospheres, as is the case with the sun. Of
the presence of the vapor of carbon in comets Professor Ball says,
&ldquo;This is a very singular fact, when it is remembered that carbon
is one of the substances essentially associated with life in the forms
in which we know it.&rdquo; Professor Huggins says, &ldquo;Since that
time the light from some twenty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217"
href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>comets has been examined by
different observers. The general close agreement in all cases,
notwithstanding some small divergencies, of the bright bands in the
cometary light with those seen in the spectrum of hydrocarbons
justifies us fully in ascribing the original light of these comets to
matter which contains carbon <i>in combination with
hydrogen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may learn something further of the constitution of comets,
perhaps, by considering the chemical reactions which their spectra seem
to indicate. The following extract is from a recent article on the
manufacture of illuminating gas: &ldquo;Ammonia contains 82.35 parts of
nitrogen and 17.65 of hydrogen. It is not produced by a direct
combination, for nitrogen can be caught and wedded only by a hot and
skilful wooing. In the gas retort, at a temperature of 2200 degrees and
in the presence of lime, <i>soda</i>, or potash, it will combine with
carbon and form cyanogen, and then further combine with the alkali to
form a cyanide. There is steam in the retort, and, as nearly as the gas
chemists can make out, the nitrogen promptly divorces itself, gives up
the carbon to the oxygen of the steam, and, taking the hydrogen to
itself, becomes, for the time at least, a fixed, if volatile,
substance, but ever ready to enter into new alliances.&rdquo; It will
be remembered that in the comets examined by Professors Huggins and
Draper the spectroscope revealed both cyanogen and the double line of
sodium. The function of the sodium is readily understood, as by its
presence it enables <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218"
name="pb218">218</a>]</span>the nitrogen in the cometic atmosphere to
combine with a part of the carbon of the gaseous hydrocarbons which
constitute this atmosphere, and thus produce the cyanogen. But to
effect this combination requires in the retort a temperature of 2200
degrees. If the combining temperature around the nucleus of a comet is
the same, it will show that the temperature of this comet&rsquo;s
nucleus must be very high, and, while many times less than that of the
sun&rsquo;s photosphere, it still clearly illustrates the powerful
character of the impact of the planetary electrical currents upon the
comet, and its tremendous repulsion by the similarly electrified solar
electrosphere. The second one of the above reactions, that from
cyanogen to ammonia, is due to the steam or aqueous vapor in the
retort. But in the case of the comet all the aqueous vapor and its
constituent oxygen have disappeared by electrolytic decomposition long
before the combining temperature of cyanogen has been reached; so that
the sodium, the hydrocarbons, and the cyanogen alone appear, and the
oxygen compounds are missing. But on the reversal of polarity of this
comet by contact with a planetary electrosphere, should such ever
occur, and its consequent assumption of positive electricity, the
oxygen would again appear, and, if the temperature had not yet receded
below that of the reaction which produces ammoniacal vapors, we might
expect, should a fragment of this comet enter our atmosphere as a
meteorite, to find ammonia as well as sodium as a constituent thereof;
otherwise the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>ammonia would be replaced by carbonic oxide and
carbonic acid, by the action of oxygen upon the hydrocarbons, and water
by the action of oxygen upon the hydrogen of the same, at much lower
temperatures than would suffice for the generation of ammonia. The
cyanogen would then perhaps remain as cyanide of sodium, unless
decomposed by contact with the meteoric metallic iron at a high
temperature, as occurs in the operation known in the arts as
&ldquo;case-hardening.&rdquo; The presence of microscopic diamonds in
meteorites may be accounted for by a somewhat similar reducing reaction
under heat and the active force of the planetary and solar voltaic
arc.</p>
<p>In the popular view comets are always associated with tails, but, in
fact, comets without tails are far more numerous than those to which
these appendages pertain; the tails, when such exist, are the direct
result of the repulsive energy of the solar electrosphere, and are only
manifested when their proximity to the sun has aroused sufficient
activity to swiftly sweep backward from the sun with inconceivable
velocity the gaseous matter concentrated in and around the nucleus. As
these tails owe their formation to the sun&rsquo;s repulsive energy,
they must always extend radially outward from the sun, and by the
self-repulsive energy of the diverse constituents of the tails
themselves these will be broken occasionally into two, four, or six
lateral strands, and (possibly by the attraction of the different
planetary electrospheres) curvatures may be apparent along the sweep of
the comets&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220"
name="pb220">220</a>]</span>tails corresponding, in effect, with
perturbations produced by gravity in the orbit of the nucleus. Of these
various phenomena, Professor Proctor, in his article on comets, says,
&ldquo;A very large number of comets have no visible tails. When first
seen in the telescope a comet usually presents a small, round disk of
hazy light, somewhat brighter near the center. As the comet approaches
the sun the disk lengthens, and, if the comet is to be a tailed one,
traces begin to be observed of a streakiness in the comet&rsquo;s
light. Gradually a tail is formed, which is turned always from the sun.
The tail grows brighter and larger, and the head becomes developed into
a coma surrounding a distinctly marked nucleus. Presently the comet is
lost to view through its near approach to the sun; but after a while it
is again seen, sometimes wonderfully changed in aspect through the
effects of solar heat. Some comets are brighter and more striking after
passing their point of nearest approach to the sun than before; others
are quite shorn of their splendor when they reappear.&rdquo; This
change of aspect is not due to solar heat, but to the energetic
repulsion of the solar electrosphere. The force of gravity irresistibly
impels the comet forward to the sun&rsquo;s electrical vortex, and the
change of aspect is due to the repulsion of its entire stock of free
gaseous matter into space in case its supply is small, or to its
increased development and pouring forth in case the supply is large. It
is like the volatilization by a heated atmosphere of ammoniacal gas,
for instance, absorbed in water. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>ebullition is vastly
increased by the heat, but if the entire stock of ammonia has been
driven off in its passage through the heated medium, it will emerge
with the residual water quiescent; otherwise, in a state of increased
agitation.</p>
<p>The same author, in &ldquo;Cometic Mysteries,&rdquo; says,
&ldquo;Repulsion of the cometary matter could only take place if this
matter, after it has been driven off from the nucleus, and the sun
<i>have both high electric potentials of the same kind</i>.&rdquo; His
further guess, however, that it is analogous to the aurora, is wide of
the mark; it is due, in fact, to the mutual repulsion of their similar
negative electrospheres, the cometic electrosphere, however, being so
much smaller than that of the sun that the latter shows no appreciable
disturbance, as is the case, under similar circumstances, with the
electrospheres of the earth and moon. In the article last quoted it is
said, &ldquo;There is a dark space immediately behind the
nucleus,&mdash;that is, where the nucleus, if solid, would throw its
shadow if there were matter to receive the light all round so that the
shadow could be seen.&rdquo; This presents, it is stated, a great
difficulty. The author, by a happy guess,&mdash;almost an inspiration,
in fact, of which this splendid writer and observer was so
full,&mdash;suggests in a foot-note a possible explanation, which,
while not in itself correct, suggests an analogous process very like
what we actually see. &ldquo;If the particles forming the envelopes are
minute flat bodies, and if anything in the circumstances under which
these particles are driven off into the tail causes them to always so
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>arrange themselves that the planes in which they
severally lie pass through the axis of the tail (which, if the tail is
an electrical phenomenon, might very well happen), then we should find
the region behind the nucleus very dark or almost black, for the
particles in the direction of the line of sight there would be turned
edgewise towards us, whereas those on either side or in the
prolongation of the envelopes would turn their faces towards the
observer.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, the envelope streaming backward
from the nucleus forms a hollow tube, the opposite sides of which
exhibit the same mutual repulsion as both exhibit towards the sun;
hence the phenomenon would be similar to that exhibited by blowing into
a closed bag of porous material covered with wisps of cotton, for
example, and the gases, in addition to their rush backward from the
sun, would also exhibit a radial rush outward from the longitudinal
axis of the tail. This is what we actually observe, and sufficiently
accounts for the phenomenon, be it altogether or only partially real,
and not merely, as that author thinks it may be, apparent. It is said,
in the same article, that &ldquo;Bredichen has shown that where there
are three tails to a comet their forms correspond with the theory that
the envelopes raised from the head are principally formed of hydrogen,
carbon, and iron; but this &hellip; seems open at present to
considerable doubt.&rdquo; At all events, these separate tails are
self-repulsive, or they would be merged into each other by the
sun&rsquo;s repulsive energy; in fact, they occupy the resultant
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>of the direction produced by the line of the
sun&rsquo;s repulsion and those of their own mutually repellent
force,&mdash;that is to say, radial or divergent.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that these tails are of insignificant
proportions. &ldquo;When we see the tail of a comet occupying a volume
thousands of times greater than that of the sun itself, the question
naturally suggests itself, &lsquo;How does it happen that so vast a
body can sweep through the solar system without deranging the motion of
every planet?<span class="corr" id="xd26e1887" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> Conceding even an extreme tenuity to the
substance composing so vast a volume, one would still expect its mass
to be tremendous. For instance, if we supposed the whole mass of the
tail of the comet of 1843 to consist of hydrogen gas (the lightest
substance known to us), yet even then the mass of the tail would have
largely exceeded that of the sun. Every planet would have been dragged
from its orbit by so vast a mass passing so near. We know, on the
contrary, that no such effects were produced. The length of our year
did not change by a single second&#8202;&hellip;. Thus we are forced to
admit that the actual substance of the comet was inconceivably
rare&#8202;&hellip;. From what we have already seen, it will be
manifest that the formation of comets&rsquo; tails is a process of a
very marvellous nature, apparently involving forces other than those
with which we are acquainted. The tail, ninety million miles in length,
which was seen stretching from the head of Newton&rsquo;s comet nearly
along the path which the retreating comet had to traverse, must, it
would seem, have been formed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href=
"#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>by some force far more active than
the force of gravity. The distance traversed by the comet in the last
<i>four weeks</i> of its approach to the sun under gravity was no
greater than that over which the matter of the tail, seen after the
comet had circled around the sun, <i>had been carried in a few
hours</i>. Yet we have no other evidence of any repulsive force at all
being exerted by the sun,&mdash;at least no evidence which can be
regarded as demonstrative,&mdash;and still less have we any evidence of
a repulsive force exceeding in energy the sun&rsquo;s attracting
power.&rdquo; (Proctor.) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href=

</div>
<p>Now, curiously enough, we have in constant use in our laboratories a
little instrument called the electroscope, in which we have manifested
very clearly a repulsive force exceeding in energy the earth&rsquo;s
attracting power, and very greatly exceeding it. It is described in
&ldquo;Electricity in the Service of Man&rdquo; as follows: &ldquo;If
we rub a large glass rod with a silk pad, we observe that it will
attract light bodies, then, after contact, repel them. During the
process we may notice a peculiar noise, and if the experiment be
carried out in the dark we may further notice sparks passing between
the rod and the rubber, and also that the rod becomes luminous.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>If we suspend a pith-ball by means of a silk
thread, on bringing the rubbed rod near the pith-ball it will move
towards the rod, touch it, and then be repelled. If the glass rod be
again brought near the pith-ball, it will move away from the glass rod,
and continue to be repelled until it has been touched by some other
body&#8202;&hellip;. In order to ascertain whether electricity is
communicated by electrified bodies to non-electrified bodies when
brought into contact, let us suspend two pith-balls from the same point
of support by threads of uniform silk, and touch the pith-balls with
the rubbed glass rod. The balls fly from the rod and also from one
another. On bringing near them a third pith-ball or any other light
body, we find that, though they repel one another, they are attracted
by the light body, showing that they have become electrified by contact
with the rubbed glass rod. From this we conclude that an unelectrified
body may be electrified by contact with an electrified body, and also
that there is repulsion after contact. There is <i>mutual repulsion
between two electrified bodies</i>, but there is attraction between a
single electrified body and one that is unelectrified.&rdquo; The
mutual repulsion of these pith-balls is the exact measure of the
strength of electrification. Hung side by side to the knob of a prime
conductor of an electrical machine, the mutual repulsion of the similar
electrospheres of these pith-balls drives them apart against the
earth&rsquo;s gravity and holds them extended, if the electrical
tension be sufficient, to their widest limit of divergence. It is, in
effect, precisely similar to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href=
"#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>the action of the solar and
cometic electrospheres (see illustration in a previous chapter, page
124), each being similarly electrified and communicating with the other
across a space which, as before stated, is freely traversable by
electric currents without appreciable resistance. That such
electrospheres are flaming with heat does not interfere with such
self-repellent action; in fact, it intensifies it. In Professor
Tyndall&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lessons in Electricity&rdquo; we read,
&ldquo;<i>Flames</i> and glowing embers act like points; they also
<i>rapidly discharge electricity</i>. The electricity escaping from a
point or flame renders the air self-repulsive. The consequence is that
when the hand is placed over a point mounted on the prime conductor of
a machine in good action a cold blast is distinctly
felt&#8202;&hellip;. Wilson moved bodies by its action, Faraday caused
it to depress the surface of a liquid, Hamilton employed the reaction
of the electric wind to make pointed wires rotate. The
&lsquo;wind&rsquo; was also found to promote evaporation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us now apply these principles to the tails of comets. If we
conceive the sun and comet to be analogous to our pith-balls, one
enormously larger than the other, however, and hung by vaporous
conducting cords from the combined generating planetary electrospheres,
both sun and cometic nucleus surrounded each by a vaporous envelope,
and suspended so that they will hang from parallel cords, say a dozen
million miles apart, and with no currents of electricity as yet in
operation, we will find that the sun and comet will be simply attracted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>towards each other by the force of gravity, so
that their suspending cords will converge. If the planetary electrical
machines now commence their rotations, and currents of electricity
begin to pass in quantity and intensity like those which pass between
the earth and the sun, both the solar and cometic pith-balls will
become similarly electrified, and their gaseous atmospheres, instead of
drawing towards each other, will become luminous and self-repulsive.
The <span class="corr" id="xd26e1933" title=
"Source: amosphere">atmosphere</span> which surrounds the cometic
pith-ball, by reason of its great tenuity, will be driven backward with
extreme velocity, while the solar pith-ball electrosphere will be so
little affected that its repulsion will be imperceptible. All the
gaseous matter, however, of the smaller pith-ball will be forced off in
a direction opposite that of the larger one, and this repulsive energy
will even carry the pith-balls apart, causing the suspending cords to
widely diverge from each other, while the force of gravity of the earth
tends to bring them nearer together. If the gravity of the larger
pith-ball, however, was equal, relatively, to that of the sun, the
result would be that the solid pith-balls would be mutually attracted
by gravitation and only the electrified atmospheres, would be mutually
repelled. This experiment would present phenomena similar to those we
are now considering. (See illustration, page 211.)</p>
<p>In describing Newton&rsquo;s comet, with a tail ninety million miles
long projected backward both from the sun and the comet, when it
disappeared in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229"
name="pb229">229</a>]</span>light of the sun, and exhibiting a similar
tail, also ninety million miles long, when, less than four days
afterwards, it reappeared from behind the sun, but with the tail now
directed forward from the comet, but in both cases extended radially
outward from the sun, it is obvious that this whole tail must have made
a sweeping change of direction of nearly one hundred and eighty degrees
upon the nucleus as its center. Professor Proctor says, &ldquo;As Sir
John Herschel remarks, we cannot look on the tail of a comet as
something whirled round like a stick as the comet circles around its
perihelion sweep. The tail with which the comet reappeared must have
been an entirely new formation.&rdquo; It is true that a comet&rsquo;s
tail cannot be conceived of as being whirled round like a stick, but we
can very readily conceive of it as something like a flame composed of
incandescent gases, and it may very easily be <i>blown</i> round a
stick; and this is precisely what must happen in the case of a comet.
Construct, for experiment, a little apparatus consisting of a blow-pipe
adapted to deliver a current of air between two horizontal metal disks,
say an eighth of an inch apart, one perforated at the center to admit
the nozzle of the blow-pipe. By directing a constant current of air
through the latter, it will be deflected so as to blow radially outward
in all directions and in the same plane. Now take a stick with a flame
on the end of it, or a lighted candle, and with it approach this center
of repellent energy in the plane of the space between the disks and
along an ellipse <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230"
name="pb230">230</a>]</span>representing the orbit of a comet. As the
flame approaches the improvised solar center it will be driven backward
from the wick of the candle almost along the line of its approach, and
as it passes around the center it will be constantly blown outward in a
radial direction until, when it recedes after perihelion, the flame
will be seen pointed almost directly ahead. At all times the direction
of the flame will lie along the radial lines prolonged outward from the
center through the wick of the candle, and it will not be a new flame
generated at every change of its direction, but the same flame
constantly forced outward by the repulsive force of the central
atmosphere in this case or the solar electrosphere in the case of the
sun. This experiment is an accurate and conclusive exhibit of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>the phenomena of solar repulsion in its action
upon the tail of a comet. It is analogous in principle to the repulsion
of the pith-balls and the electric wind and (in application) to the
phenomena presented by comets in their movements to, around, and from
the sun. This repulsion is not operative in effect against the wick of
the candle,&mdash;that is to say, it is not the repulsion of the
nucleus which determines the direction of the tail, but the repulsion
by direct outblow of the sun, so to speak, upon the incandescent gases
of the tail itself. This fact clearly demonstrates that the repulsion
of like electrospheres is the cause of the phenomenon, and, when once
understood, the process is quite as simple as that of the original
formation of the tail itself, which no one disputes.</p>

</div>
<p>There is to be further considered the theoretical resistance of
space to the projection and deflection of such enormous volumes of
attenuated matter as appear in comets&rsquo; tails. While it may not be
absolutely necessary to offer an explanation of this apparent
difficulty, in view of the fact that such projection and deflection do
actually occur, still, the well-known laws of the diffusion of gases,
in accordance with which any gaseous matter will traverse any other
gaseous matter with the same velocity as, and with no more resistance
than, in a vacuum, will show that this difficulty has been much
overrated, while for the twin difficulty, how to account for the
persistence of luminosity at such vast distances from its source, we
may quote from Professor Proctor, &ldquo;Cometic Mysteries,&rdquo; who,
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>turn, quotes as follows: &ldquo;Comets travel in
what must be regarded as to all intents and purposes a vacuum. From Dr.
Crookes&rsquo; experiments on very high vacua we may infer that there
is very little loss of heat, except by radiation.&rdquo; By
&ldquo;intents and purposes&rdquo; we understand, of course, as a cause
of resistance, and certainly there is no reason to believe that the
attenuated vapors of space are sufficient in density to cause any rapid
diffusion of heat by convection, as contrasted with that of
radiation.</p>
<p>We have seen that comets of short period sometimes disappear, and
that their disappearance is frequently followed by the appearance of
trains of meteors. In other words, they have apparently lost their
cometic properties and become permanent adjuncts to our solar system. A
curious confirmation of this fact is to be found in the character of
the occluded gases which are contained in such meteorites as sometimes
fall upon the earth&rsquo;s surface. Of this Professor Proctor says,
&ldquo;We have reason to believe that the nucleus of a comet consists
of an aggregation of stones similar to meteorites.&rdquo; Speaking of
the condition in which meteorites reach the earth, he says, &ldquo;They
are known to contain as much as six times their own volume of gases
(taken at atmospheric pressure). In one of these meteorites recently
examined by Dr. Flight, the following percentages of various gases were
noted: Of carbonic oxide, 31.88; of carbonic acid gas, 0.12; of
hydrogen, 45.79; of olefiant gas, 4.55; and of nitrogen, 17.66.&rdquo;
The presence of olefiant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href=
"#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>gas at once suggests the
hydrocarbons of the cometic nucleus. The presence of this gas cannot be
accounted for by the passage of the meteorite through our atmosphere,
nor can that of hydrogen, and these are two characteristic gases,
together with the vapor of carbon, constantly found to exist in
comets.</p>
<p>As before explained, the advent of a comet into our solar system is
that of a stranger, with electric polarity the opposite of that of the
planetary electrospheres and identical with that of the sun. Under the
combined influence of the solar gravity and perturbation by the gravity
of the planets these foreign bodies tend to shorten their periods, and
finally fall into the ordinary array of the bodies which compose our
own solar system. But when this occurs they will, in turn, become
contributors to, instead of antagonists of, the energy of the sun; in
other words, they must then conform electrically to the condition of
the family into which they have married,&mdash;that is to say, the
planets,&mdash;and a reversal of their electrical polarity will take
place. This reversal of polarity is no novelty in the operation of
electrical apparatus. In &ldquo;Electricity in the Service of
Man&rdquo; we read as follows of the Voss induction machine:
&ldquo;This machine is exceedingly powerful in favorable weather, but
has an important defect <i>in a tendency to self-reversal, which is apt
to occur at a stoppage</i>. This defect can be produced in a Voss
machine, when desired, <i>by holding a metal point</i> to the positive
brush <i>K</i>. The two derived inductive circuits are beautifully
manifested <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>when this machine is worked in the dark. A
luminous stream is seen pouring towards the collecting comb <i>L</i> on
whichever side of the machine the comb is positive.&rdquo; It will thus
be seen that simple contact of a neutral (or negatively opposite) body
will reverse the electrical polarity of this machine, or even the
interruption of its motion will do so at times. Possibly a similar
reversal may be produced in a comet by the contact in whole or in part
of its nucleus with a planetary electrosphere, since the action of
gravity is entirely independent of that of the attraction or repulsion
of the electrospheres of both planetary and cometic bodies. Such
reversal of polarity in a comet would at once extinguish its
luminosity, and the generation of oxygen would at once replace the
prior generation of hydrogen, and herein we may find explained the
presence of carbonic oxide in large volume and carbonic acid in small
volume in the meteorite above referred to, and of which gases Professor
Proctor says, &ldquo;It is quite certain these gases were not taken up
by the meteorolite during its flight through the air.&rdquo; These
aggregations of discrete meteoric bodies, loosely adherent by mutual
gravity alone, would be gradually torn apart by planetary interference
and dragged into streams of small bodies, thenceforth traversing space
in elliptical orbits around the sun, just as do the planets and
planetoids. Cyanogen, also, the deadly gas so frequently found to exist
in enormous quantities in the nuclei of comets, would at once
disappear, by double conversion into carbonic acid, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>or
oxide, and ammonia, or nitrogen, so that this danger, as the result of
a comet&rsquo;s possible approach to the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, may
be dismissed from apprehension.</p>
<p>It will be seen that all the enormous difficulties in the phenomena
of comets find an explanation in the operation of the same universal
laws which we have endeavored to apply to the other sidereal bodies. In
conclusion, we may cite the following from Dr. Huggins: &ldquo;Broadly,
the different applications of principles of electricity which have been
suggested group themselves about the common idea that great electrical
disturbances are set up by the sun&rsquo;s action in connection with
the vaporization of some of the matter of the nucleus, and that the
tail is probably matter carried away, possibly in connection with
electric discharges, under an electrical influence of repulsion exerted
by the sun. This view necessitates the supposition that the sun is
strongly electrified, either negatively or positively, and, further,
that in the processes taking place in the comet, either of vaporization
or of some other kind, the matter thrown out by the nucleus has become
strongly electrified in the same way as the sun,&mdash;that is,
negatively if the sun&rsquo;s electricity is negative, or positively if
the sun&rsquo;s is positive. The enormous disturbances which the
spectroscope shows to be always at work in the sun must be accompanied
by electrical changes of equal magnitude, but we know nothing as to how
far these are all, or the great majority of them, in one direction, so
as to cause the sun to maintain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"
href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>permanently a high electrical
state, whether positive or negative.&rdquo; The above speculations will
have thus become demonstrated facts (though not in the mode suggested
by the above writer) as soon as we clearly understand that, instead of
the sun&rsquo;s &ldquo;enormous disturbances&rdquo; producing
&ldquo;electrical changes of equal magnitude,&rdquo; it is the
electrical changes of equal magnitude which themselves cause the
sun&rsquo;s disturbances, and that the sun&rsquo;s negative electrical
polarity is permanently fixed by the opposite and positive polarity of
the planetary electrospheres, and that all these various phenomena are
but the normal expression of a single universal law, and are all due to
the constant interaction of planetary, solar, and cometic
electrospheres, in accordance with the well-established principles of
electrical science. If, however, we consider, as is generally believed
to be the case, the sun itself to be the sole prime source of its
visible energy, nothing but difficulty and vague speculation can be
looked for on every hand; but by relegating the solar orb to its proper
place, and taking as the starting-point the true source of all
energy,&mdash;to wit, the hidden forces embodied in the vapors or gases
of interstellar space,&mdash;the whole process and mode of action will
logically follow, and obscurity and difficulty together disappear. This
principle, properly understood, is a master-key which will unlock every
problem and interpret every enigma which the realms of interstellar
space can present. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237"

<h2 class="main">THE RESOLVABLE NEBUL&AElig;, STAR-CLUSTERS AND
GALAXIES.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When we come to consider the nebul&aelig;, and
endeavor to learn what part electricity has to play in the phenomena
presented by these singular objects, we must recollect, in order to
give them their due importance, that they are neither few in number nor
uniform in constitution. Of the nebul&aelig;, Professor Proctor
(&ldquo;Star-Clouds and Star-Mist&rdquo;) says, &ldquo;When the depths
of the heavens are explored with a powerful telescope a number of
strange cloud-like objects are brought into view. It is startling to
consider that if the eye of man suddenly acquired the light-gathering
power of a large telescope, and if at the same time all the single
stars disappeared, we should see on the celestial vault a display of
the mysterious objects called nebul&aelig; or star-clouds exceeding in
number all the stars which can now be seen on the darkest night in
winter. The whole sky would seem mottled with these singular
objects.&rdquo; As telescopes, with the advances of constructive art,
increased in power, these luminous clouds became more and more clearly
defined, and many of them became resolved into clusters of stars,
galaxies of suns like the Milky Way, of which latter our solar system
is a constituent part, but more distant from us than the separately
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>visible stars of that galaxy, and each separated
from the relatively adjacent clusters by intervals of space comparable
only with those which separate them from our own system. Of these
glorious star-clusters, says Flammarion, in &ldquo;The Wonders of the
Heavens,&rdquo; &ldquo;In the bosom of infinite space, the unfathomable
depth of which we have tried to comprehend, float rich clusters of
stars, each separated by immense intervals. We shall soon show that all
the stars are suns like ours, shining with their own light, and foci of
as many systems of worlds. Now, the stars are not scattered in all
parts of space at hazard; they are grouped as the members of many
families. If we compared the ocean of the heavens with the ocean of the
earth, we should say that the isles which sprinkle this ocean do not
rise separately in all parts of the sea, but that they are united here
and there in archipelagoes more or less rich&#8202;&hellip;. They are
all collected in tribes, most of which count their members by
millions.&rdquo; Says Professor Nichol, &ldquo;System on system of
majesty unspeakable float through the fathomless ocean of space. Our
galaxy, with splendors that seem illimitable, is only a unit among
unnumbered throngs; we can think of it, in comparison with creation,
but as we were wont to think of one of its own stars. &ldquo;Of these
glorious star-clusters the same writer says, &ldquo;That no one has
ever seen them in a telescope of adequate power without uttering a
shout of wonder.&rdquo; These mist-like star-clouds were successively
resolved, nebula by nebula, until science settled into the belief that
with telescopes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239"
name="pb239">239</a>]</span>of adequate power all nebul&aelig; might be
so resolved, and the capacity of telescopes to thus resolve
nebul&aelig; became a test of their power. But spectrum analysis
finally entered the lists with new methods of investigation, and the
comparatively tiny spectroscope at a single leap passed far beyond the
utmost limits of the highest telescopic vision, and at one blow struck
the whole category of nebul&aelig; into two widely different
classes,&mdash;those composed of discrete stars grouped like the suns
of our own Milky Way, and exhibiting the characteristic spectra of such
bodies, and those composed of diffused gaseous matter not yet condensed
into suns, and showing the disconnected spectral lines of simple
elemental gases. The line of division was clear, direct, positive, and
beyond all dispute. Yet beyond these two classes further research has
disclosed certain vast nebul&aelig; in which some portions exhibit true
solar spectra more or less modified and others true gaseous spectra,
each apparently merging into the other by gradations so faint and
delicate that the inference is irresistible that in these nebul&aelig;
we see the processes of galactic and solar creation at various stages
of their development.</p>
<p>Of these nebul&aelig;, Professor Ball says, &ldquo;In one of his
most remarkable papers, Sir W. Herschel presents us with a summary of
his observations on the nebul&aelig;, arranged in such a manner as to
suggest his theory of the gradual transmutation of nebul&aelig; into
stars. He first shows us that there are regions in the heavens where a
faint diffused <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>nebulosity is all that can be detected by the
telescope. There are other nebul&aelig; in which a nucleus can be just
discerned, others again in which the nucleus is easily seen, and still
others where the nucleus is a bright star-like point. The transition
from an object of this kind to a nebulous star is very natural, while
the nebulous stars pass into the ordinary stars by a few graduated
stages. It is thus possible to enumerate a series of objects, beginning
at one end with the most diffused nebulosity and ending at the other
with an ordinary fixed star or group of stars. Each object in the
series differs but slightly from the object just before it and just
after it.&rdquo; And of these composite nebul&aelig;, he adds,
&ldquo;The great nebula in Orion is known to be the most glorious body
of its class that the heavens display. Seen through a powerful
telescope, &hellip; the appearance of this grand &lsquo;light
stain&rsquo; is of indescribable glory. It is a vast volume of bluish
gaseous material with hues of infinite softness and delicacy. Here it
presents luminous tracts which glow with an exquisite blue light; there
it graduates off until it is impossible to say where the nebula ceases
and the black sky begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With reference to these distant galaxies of apparently complete
solar systems like our own, the same principles must regulate the
conversion of this energy of planetary electricity into the energy of
solar light and heat as we see manifested in our own sun. The light of
the individual stars is sufficient evidence of this; but the question
may be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>asked, Is the electrical interaction between
separate galaxies and between different solar systems in the same
galaxy universal, or are these operations merely local? In other words,
Is the source and the mode of solar energy in accordance with a single
universal law of and between all created universes, or is it limited in
effective energy to the members of each individual solar system alone?
The answer is, that it is not less universal than the law of
gravitation and no more so. There is a prevalent popular fallacy that
the force of gravity is such that the movements, not only of solar
systems, but of whole galaxies, and of all the illimitable systems of
galaxies, are under its effective control, and that the whole universe
of boundless space acknowledges its overwhelming sway. But nothing can
be further from the truth. We know, of course, that the law is
universal, as expressed in the statement of its terms by Newton, but
the mere statement of the law itself, as applied to interstellar
distances, refutes the idea that solar systems and galaxies can rotate
around any common center by virtue of the attraction of gravitation as
a controlling force. The universality of the law itself has even been
doubted. Professor Ball says, &ldquo;In the first book about astronomy
which I read in my boyhood there was a glowing
description&#8202;&hellip;. I allude to the discovery, or the alleged
discovery, of a certain &lsquo;central sun&rsquo; about which it was
believed or stated that all the bodies in the universe
revolved&#8202;&hellip;. It was too good to be true. No one ever hears
anything about the central sun <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242"
href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>hypothesis
nowadays&#8202;&hellip;. It must be, then, admitted that when the law
of gravitation is spoken of as being universal, we are using language
infinitely more general than the facts absolutely warrant. At the
present moment we only know that gravitation exists to a very small
extent in a certain indefinite small portion of space. Our knowledge
would have to be enormously increased before we could assert that
gravitation was in operation throughout this very limited region; and
even when we have proved this, we should only have made an
infinitesimal advance to a proof that gravitation is absolutely
universal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyone who chooses may prove for himself that the force exercised by
gravitation between the multitudinous suns of our own galaxy, the Milky
Way, and our earth must be quite infinitesimal, and totally unable to
control the motions of our own solar system in a definite orbit through
universal space. We know that the law which regulates the intensity of
light at various distances is the same as the law of
gravity,&mdash;that is to say, the proportion is directly as the mass
and inversely as the square of the distance. We know also that the
stars which compose the Milky Way are similarly constituted, generally
considered, to our own sun, and that under similar circumstances the
emission of light, roughly speaking, will vary according to the
magnitude of these distant suns. Now, if any one will stand, at the
darkest hour of the night, when the moon is absent and the sky
perfectly cloudless, when the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243"
href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Stars that oversprinkle all the heavens seem to
twinkle</p>
<p class="line xd26e2012">With a crystalline delight,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and sweep with his gaze all the concave hemisphere of
the sky, and then compare the light which is radiated around him with
the gorgeous effulgence of the noonday summer sun, he can pretty
closely compare the relative attraction of gravity which all those
distant suns together can exercise upon our earth with that of our own
sun. Under control of the latter, the earth sweeps around in her orbit
at the rate of about twenty miles per second; all these suns could not
give our solar system even a minute fraction of that. Of this starlight
Professor Ball says, &ldquo;The sun certainly must receive some heat by
the radiation from the stars; but this is quite infinitesimal in
comparison with his own stupendous radiation.&rdquo; Any such
attraction, of course, could not control the motions of our solar
system, and much less that of many of the others.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The night has a thousand eyes, and the day but
one,</p>
<p class="line">But the light of the whole world dies when the day is
done.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">We can also demonstrate the fact mathematically by an
exceedingly rough calculation, which, however, will be sufficient for
our purpose. Of the Milky Way, which comprises only the stars of our
own sidereal system, Professor Ball says, &ldquo;One hundred million
stars are presumed to be disposed in a flat circular layer of such
dimensions that a ray of light would require thirty thousand years to
traverse one diameter.&rdquo; (The most recent estimates <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>make
the number of the stars which compose the Milky Way several times one
hundred million, occupying a correspondingly greater amplitude of
space. The number in any case is sufficiently stupendous.) Our solar
system is located in space at the apex of a vast transverse cleft, and
nearly at the center of this disk. Let us leave out of consideration
the lower half of the Milky Way, as we look upward on a starlit night,
and conceive this galaxy to extend only across the midnight sky above
us like an archway, with fifty million suns, visible and invisible,
exposed in the field of our vision. The nearest of all the fixed stars
to us is that known as Alpha Centauri,&mdash;not visible, however, in
our northern skies. This star is about two hundred and thirty thousand
times as far from our sun as is the earth. If of the same mass as our
sun, it must exert upon us an attractive force of gravity one
fifty-three-billionth that of our own sun. Next in distance is the star
No. 61 of the constellation Cygnus. This may be three times as distant,
and is certainly not less than twice. The light of the former will
reach the earth in three and one-quarter years; that of the latter in
not less than six and one-half years, perhaps much more. These are our
nearest stellar neighbors. While the former will attract us with only
one fifty-three-thousand-millionth that of the sun, the latter will
attract us with less than one two-hundred-thousand-millionth that of
our sun. Conceive, then, a square pyramid extending radially upward for
three thousand times the mean of these distances to the upper
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>probable limits of the Milky Way, a
light-distance of fifteen thousand years, and that this pyramid expands
according to the squares of its distances, so that it will contain
within it, equally distributed, all the stars (fifty million) of the
upper half of the disk of the Milky Way; the sum total of all these
attractions could not reach one twenty-millionth part of that of our
sun upon the earth. If we continue to pile galaxies, in the same
perpetual recession, behind each other to all infinity, we still could
not engender sufficient attractive force to control the observed
movements of the multitudinous stars of space. The very statement of
the law of gravitation itself disproves it; for if we multiply orbs and
systems according to any principle of aggregation that we know of in
the way of distribution of such systems, or anything possible, with due
regard to their own mutually interacting movements in space, we could
never reach the inside limits of such a sphere of control, because the
piling up of orb behind orb adds but an infinitesimal fraction to the
force of gravity, for as the orbs themselves multiply in distance
progressively by hundreds, their relative attractions inversely
diminish by ten thousands. No possible increase of suns directly in
mass could compensate for such an inverse ratio of squares, even if all
intergalactic space were peopled with suns, instead of being, in fact,
like a vast ocean, with a few small clusters of islands scattered here
and there throughout its illimitable extent.</p>
<p>Of these vast realms of space, Professor Ball <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>asks, &ldquo;Is our sidereal system to be
regarded as an oceanic island in space, or is it in such connection
with the systems in other parts of space as might lead us to infer that
the various systems had a common character? The evidence seems to show
that the stars in our system are probably not permanently associated
together, but that in the course of time some stars enter our system
and other stars leave it, in such manner as to suggest that the bodies
visible to us are fairly typical of the general contents of the
universe. The strongest evidence that can be presented on this subject
is met with in the peculiar circumstances of one particular star. The
star in question is known as No. 1830 of Groombridge&rsquo;s catalogue.
It is a small star, not to be seen without the aid of a
telescope&#8202;&hellip;. We shall probably be quite correct in
assuming that the distance is not less than two hundred billions of
miles&#8202;&hellip;. The velocity is no less than two hundred miles
per second&#8202;&hellip;. The star sweeps along through our system
with this stupendous velocity&#8202;&hellip;. The velocity being over
twenty-five miles a second, the attraction can never overcome the
velocity, so that the star seems destined to escape.&rdquo; Of the star
Alcyone he says, &ldquo;Doubtless that star is thousands of billions of
miles from the earth; doubtless the light from it requires thousands of
years&mdash;and some astronomers have said millions of years&mdash;to
span the abyss which intervenes between our globe and those distant
regions.&rdquo; And yet these stars, these galaxies, and even all the
nebul&aelig; we see or ever shall see, are merely in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>vestibule of space; we have scarcely even yet
lifted the outer curtain at the entrance of those vast realms. That the
popular, but pseudo-scientific, idea of a series of ever-widening
concentric orbits, increasing at every new expansion by an
inconceivable ratio, is incredible we can well understand, and it is a
satisfaction to know that such a wild hypothesis finds no warrant in
the dicta or the demonstrations of science. And it is in the failure of
gravity to control over the intervening space which lies between those
vastly distant centers that we may hope to find the inklings of a more
far-reaching law, by which nebul&aelig; like that of Orion crystallize
out into separate star systems, just as in the rocks, whether igneous,
metamorphic, or sedimentary, we find the attraction of cohesion yield
to that of crystallization, until the whole cleft rock blazes with
countless garnets in the schist and quartz crystals in the gneiss, or
reveals the yellow specks of olivine in volcanic ejections.</p>
<p>We shall find in the processes concerned with the development of
living things the workings of a similar great law, perhaps the same.
Wherever there is the possibility of life, there we find life. There
seems to be an all-pervading vital tension, so to speak, an energizing
force, which drives the evolution and ascent of life forward and upward
by successive leaps, as it were, from type to type, from race to race,
and even from nation to nation. In this universal forward movement we
may dimly discern the primordial creative and developing impulse,
constantly acting, but manifesting visible <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>change only at intervals as gathering forces
accumulate and equilibrium is disturbed. It manifests itself in all the
fields of nature,&mdash;vital, chemical, molecular, molar, systemic. It
is the ever-acting, eternal past, present, and future, the macrocosm
and the microcosm, the panurgus, the Brahma, the Ancient of Days, and
cannot be silenced or evaded:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;They reckon ill who leave me out,</p>
<p class="line">When <span class="sc">me</span> they fly I am the
wings.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">R. Kalley Miller, in his &ldquo;Romance of
Astronomy,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;It would be hopeless to attempt
expressing in ordinary language the vast distance at which these
clusters of stars are situated from us. If we were to reckon it in
miles, or even in millions of miles, figures would pile upon figures
till in their number all definite idea of their value was lost. We must
choose another unit to measure these infinitudes of space,&mdash;a unit
compared with which the dimensions of our own solar system shrink into
absolute nothingness. The velocity of light is such that it would flash
fifteen times from pole to pole of our earth between two beats of the
pendulum. It bridges the huge chasm that separates us from the sun in
little more than eight minutes. But the light that shows us these faint
star-clusters has been travelling with this frightful velocity for more
than two million years since it left its distant source. We see them
to-day in the fields of our telescopes, not as they are now, but as
they were countless ages before the creation of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>man
upon the earth. What they are now who can tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The movements of solar systems through space are unquestionably
controlled by some wider law than that of gravitation, and it still
remains for science to seek its hidden principles and discover its mode
of operation. We know that some stars travel alone, like the star
already noted, No. 1830 of Groombridge&rsquo;s catalogue; that others
travel in pairs, like the double star Mizar and its companion Alcor;
and others in groups, like the stars Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon and
Zeta, of the constellation Ursa Major; that we are driving towards the
constellation Lyra and leaving behind us Sirius and its fellows, and
that many, if not all, of the stars whose motions we can measure have a
rapid movement through space, but under what control, in accord with
what hidden harmony, and under what general plan they move, we do not
know; but the laws of electrical action of the circling planets upon
their central suns, and of these upon space, we can readily account for
by the similar operation of the same laws within our own solar domain;
and we know by the similar terms of the ratio of distribution of light
that this is commensurate in extent with the law of gravity, and
operates in a like proportion of energy over all intervening distances;
so that wherever our sun presents a visible point of light, there it is
pouring its energy into space, and every sun we can see, every galaxy,
every star-cluster, nay, every nebula, is likewise pouring into the
interplanetary space of our own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250"
href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>solar system its
proportionate quota of energy. The very fact that we can see the star
shine is itself the fullest evidence that this is so, and evidence also
that the law of gravitation there, too, is still in force, operating
over these same distances, and with the same proportionate energy.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, we can read with a new light the grand vistas of
the skies, with their starry denizens, and claim them all as parts of
our own family; and the mutual interchange of attractive energy and of
light and heat will not fail between us until those inconceivable
distances shall have been reached which human knowledge can never span
and where speculation fails; and even there, from out those dark
abysses,&mdash;dark to our human eyes,&mdash;the call will still
faintly reach us, and our response will reach them also, though we
shall never have tangible evidence that such mutual ties continue to
exist. Industriously our planets gather their mighty energies from the
surrounding springs of space, as one dips water from a crystal stream;
we hand it over to our sun, and he, the royal high-priest, sprinkles it
in glittering diamond-sprays over all those countless suns and their
subject worlds, and they are baptized with an eternal baptism into our
common brotherhood and we into theirs. Our familiar planets, Mars,
Jupiter, Neptune, the earth, and even our little moon, seem to raise
their voices and take actual part in the councils of almighty power, to
move about as perpetual benefactors, gathering and spreading
beneficence abroad, instead of cowering, a hapless few, like
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>storm-stayed travellers, around the dying embers
of our poor old sun, passive recipients of the light and heat and life
which we have been taught to believe are slowly sinking into ashes and
fading away in eternal darkness and death. One swift glance into these
boundless truths is better for the human soul than the slow passage of
whole hopeless centuries, which leave as their inevitable legacy on
earth a vast and final catastrophe, in which everything that gave us
light and heat and being must perish forever. Has it, indeed, come to
this, that the last word which science has to offer is, &ldquo;After us
the deluge&rdquo;? By no means. We have merely been endeavoring to
measure the right hand of God by weighing and measuring a single
isolated one of his countless multitude of suns.</p>
<p>It is as though one standing beside a great water-wheel should
estimate its power and rotation by measuring the width and depth of the
buckets and calculating the weight of water which its thirty-two
receptacles contain, saying, &ldquo;at its present rate in so many
seconds it will cease to move.&rdquo; But we take him to the
water-gate, and show it wide open; to the great dam above it which
contains cubic miles of water; and still beyond that to the mighty
fountains bursting forth with their rush and roar from the rock-ribbed
fastnesses of the eternal hills, and pouring their unfailing flood-tide
down forever and ever. And we do not pause even here: we show him the
vapors rising from the spent water again, condensing into clouds,
pouring down in torrents of rain among the hills, and that these
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>continuously feed the sources of the fountains,
which in turn supply the wheel almost to bursting. And so it is with
the glorious mechanism of the heavens.</p>
<p>The source of solar energy is not to be found in the sun itself, but
in his environment; and he himself, in all his glory, is but the king,
crowned with gold, blazing with rich apparel, and scattering benefits
among his satellites, not from his own private treasury, but who
himself is enriched by the mighty tribute with which his willing
subjects continually endow him, and to whom alone he owes all his pride
and power and wealth and magnificence, and which he, in turn, so freely
expends, transmuted in form alone, in the perpetual improvement and
welfare of his domain. He is the faithful ruler, but not the creator;
the beneficent monarch, but not the god. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">THE GASEOUS NEBUL&AElig;.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When we reach the irresolvable nebul&aelig;, we
unquestionably have approached the creative period of solar systems and
in many cases of whole galaxies. These are multifarious in form, but
all can be reduced to a few comprehensive types. In determining the
question as to whether these irresolvable nebul&aelig; were composed of
distinct stars like the Milky Way, but too distant to be resolved from
their mist-like light into discrete stars by the most powerful
telescopes, or whether they were gaseous in constitution,&mdash;that
is, composed of diffused gaseous elements not condensed into solar
bodies,&mdash;the spectroscope became the final and infallible test. Of
this instrument, thus used, Professor Proctor, in his
&ldquo;Star-Clouds and Star-Mist,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;A very few words
will explain the whole matter to readers who remember the three
fundamental laws of this new mode of investigation,&mdash;viz., that,
first, light from a burning solid or liquid source gives the
rainbow-colored streak of light commonly known as the prismatic
spectrum; secondly, when vapors surround such a source of light, the
rainbow-colored streak is crossed by dark lines; and, thirdly, when the
source of light is gas, there is no longer a rainbow-colored streak,
but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>merely a finite number of bright lines.&rdquo;
Dr. Huggins selected for investigation the small planetary nebula in
the Dragon. He says, &ldquo;When I had directed the telescope armed
with the spectrum apparatus to this nebula, I at first suspected that
some derangement of the instrument had taken place, for no spectrum was
seen, but only a short line of light. I then found that the light of
this nebula, unlike any other extra-terrestrial light which had yet
been subjected by me to prismatic analysis, was of definite colors, and
therefore could not form a spectrum. A great part of the light is
monochromatic, and so remains concentrated in a bright line occupying a
position in the spectrum corresponding to its color. Careful
examination showed a narrower and much fainter line near the one first
discovered. Beyond this point, about three times as far from the first
line, was a third exceedingly faint line. From the position of one of
the bright lines it is inferred the <i>gas nitrogen</i> is one of the
constituents of the nebula; another line indicates the <i>existence of
the gas hydrogen</i> in that far-off system; the third line has not yet
been associated with any known terrestrial element, though it is near
one belonging to the metal barium, and <i>still nearer one belonging to
oxygen</i>; a fourth line occasionally seen <i>belongs to
hydrogen</i>.&rdquo; Professor Proctor says, &ldquo;Dr. Huggins
examined a large number of the planetary nebul&aelig; (so called),
obtaining in each case a spectrum which indicates gaseity. In some
cases only one line could be seen, in others two, more commonly three,
and in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>a few instances four. When these lines were seen
they invariably corresponded in position with those already described.
The single line sometimes seen corresponded with the brightest line of
the three; and when a second line was visible, this also was no new
line, but agreed with the second brightest line in the three-line
spectrum. The fourth line was seen only in the spectrum of a very
bright, small, blue planetary nebula, but was later observed in other
cases, and especially in the great Orion nebula.&rdquo; At this time
the latter was not visible, but when Dr. Huggins had opportunity to
examine it, he says, &ldquo;The telescopic observations of this nebula
seem to show that it is suitable to a crucial test of the usually
received opinion that the resolution of a nebula into bright stellar
points is a certain indication that the nebula consists of discrete
stars.&rdquo; Professor Proctor says, &ldquo;A simple glance resolved
the difficulty. The light from the brightest part of the
nebula&mdash;the very part which under Lord Rosse&rsquo;s great
reflector blazed with innumerable points of light&mdash;gave a spectrum
identical in all respects with that which Huggins had obtained from the
planetary nebul&aelig;. Thus, what had been deemed boldness in
Herschel&mdash;namely, that he should have associated the wildest and
most fantastic nebula in the heavens with the circular and (in ordinary
telescopes) almost uniformly luminous planetary nebul&aelig;&mdash;was
unexpectedly confirmed.&rdquo; The spectrum of this nebula has more
recently been photographed by a long exposure in the camera of the
prepared plate. Of the result, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256"
href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>Professor Proctor thus
speaks, &ldquo;The nebula is seen to be in great part gaseous, and,
where gaseous, to shine in the main with the tints described above; but
parts of the nebula are not gaseous, and those portions which are so
are not all constituted in the same manner&#8202;&hellip;. That portion
which is called the fish&rsquo;s mouth gives a continuous spectrum; in
other words, the same spectrum which we obtain from a star or a
star-cluster. This is the spectrum arising from a glowing solid or
liquid mass, or if from a gaseous body, then the gaseous body must be
in a state of great compression&#8202;&hellip;. But the stars thus
forming must be immersed in the glowing gas forming the general
substance of the nebula&#8202;&hellip;. It would be absurd to suppose
that the nebula is a flat surface; &hellip; nebulous matter lies also,
in all probability (certainly one might fairly say), between us and the
stellar aggregration as well as on the farther side.&rdquo; Further,
the same author says, &ldquo;If, as is probable, the luminosity of the
gaseous portion of the Orion nebula is accompanied by but a relatively
small proportion of heat, then the rays from the violet and
ultra-violet part of the spectrum are likely to give us much more
complete information respecting the constitution of these nebulous
masses than can be derived from the visible part of the
spectrum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the recent work of Professor Ball, &ldquo;In the High
Heavens,&rdquo; that author says, &ldquo;There are, however, good
grounds for believing that nebul&aelig; really do undergo some changes,
at least as regards brightness; but whether these changes are such as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>Herschel&rsquo;s theory would seem to require is
quite another question. Perhaps the best-authenticated instance is that
of the variable nebula in the constellation of Taurus, discovered by
Mr. Hind in 1852. At the time of its discovery this object was a small
nebula about one minute in diameter, with a central condensation of
light. D&rsquo;Arrest, the distinguished astronomer of Copenhagen,
found in 1861 that this nebula had vanished. On the 29th of December,
1861, the nebula was again seen in the powerful refractor at Pulkova,
but on December 12, 1863, Mr. Hind failed to detect it with the
telescope by which it had been originally discovered&#8202;&hellip;. In
1868, O. Struve, observing at Pulkova, detected another nebulous spot
in the vicinity of the place of the missing object, but this also has
now vanished. Struve, however, does not consider that the nebula of
1868 is distinct from Hind&rsquo;s nebula, but he says, &lsquo;What I
see is certainly the variable nebula itself, only in altered brightness
and spread over a larger space. Some traces of nebulosity are still to
be seen exactly on the spot where Hind and D&rsquo;Arrest placed the
variable nebula. It is a remarkable circumstance that this nebula is in
the vicinity of a variable star which changes somewhat irregularly from
the ninth to the twelfth magnitude. At the time of the discovery in
1861 both the star and the nebula were brighter than they have since
become.&rsquo;&hellip; It must be admitted that the changes are such as
would not be expected if Herschel&rsquo;s theory were universally true.
Another remarkable occurrence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258"
href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>in modern astronomy may be
cited as having some bearing on the question as to the actual evidence
for or against Herschel&rsquo;s theory. On November 24, 1876, Dr.
Schmidt noticed a new star of the third magnitude in the constellation
Cygnus&#8202;&hellip;. The brilliancy gradually declined until, on the
13th of December, Mr. Hind found it to be of the sixth magnitude. The
spectrum &hellip; exhibited several bright lines which indicated that
the star differed from other stars by the possession of vast masses of
glowing gaseous material&#8202;&hellip;. September 2, 1877, it was then
below the tenth magnitude and of a decidedly bluish tint. Viewed
through the spectroscope, its light was almost completely
monochromatic, and appeared to be indistinguishable from that which is
often found to come from nebul&aelig;&#8202;&hellip;. It would seem
certain that we have an instance before us in which a star has changed
into a planetary nebula of small angular diameter&#8202;&hellip;.
Professor Pickering, however, has since found slight traces of a
continuous spectrum, but the object has now become so extremely faint
that such observations are very difficult&#8202;&hellip;. For the
nebular theory we require evidence of the conversion of nebul&aelig;
into stars.&rdquo; And not, it may be added, of stars into
nebul&aelig;.</p>
<p>Of the irregular nebul&aelig;, Professor Proctor says, &ldquo;It may
well chance, as long since suggested by Professor Clark, of Cincinnati,
and as more cautiously hinted by Dr. Huggins, that in the varieties of
constitution observed in the irregular nebul&aelig;, and the evidence
such varieties afford of progressive <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>changes, we may find
not merely direct evidence of the development of suns and sun-systems
from the great masses of nebulous matter, but even what would be a far
more important and impressive result,&mdash;actual evidence of the
development of so-called elements from substances really elementary,
or, at any rate, one stage nearer the elementary condition than are our
hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and so forth. The peculiarity of
the spectral indications of the presence of nitrogen and hydrogen in
the nebula, that only one line of nitrogen and two or three lines of
hydrogen are discernible, instead of a complete spectrum of either
element as seen under any known conditions, seems suggestive of what
may be called a more elemental condition of hydrogen and
nitrogen.&rdquo; Whether this be so, or whether these peculiarities are
due to self-obscuration, or mutual reversal of the familiar lines due
to the enormous disturbances of the nebular mass which must exist, it
is certain that there is one terrestrial substance, at least, which
acts invariably, in combination and chemical affinity, as a simple
element in inorganic chemistry, but which is, in fact,
compound,&mdash;to wit, the hypothetical radical ammonium, which is
closely allied with the simple alkaline metals potassium and sodium,
forming with them a single group; and yet, while the others have always
remained as fixed, primitive elements, the hypothetical element
ammonium alone is a composite substance consisting of hydrogen and
nitrogen, two of the invariable gaseous constituents of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>all
these nebul&aelig;. In comets we find, vaguely expressed, an occasional
strongly marked sodium line, and also the spectrum of carbon; in these
gaseous nebul&aelig; we find, as yet, no trace of carbon, and this
element is so closely allied to hydrogen in its chemical affinities and
reactions as to suggest that it may be the same element or some alloy
of it, or in some allotropic form, as we find to be the case with other
simple elements under special conditions. In organic
chemistry&mdash;the chemistry of organic life&mdash;we find almost
innumerable compound radicals which act as simple elements in
combination, but which we can combine and separate into their
constituents at will; to all intents and purposes, in their various
reactions, they behave as elemental substances, and were it not that
our analyses are able to resolve them, as the spectroscope resolves the
nebul&aelig;, we might well believe that here also we were dealing with
simple primary elements. It is almost certain that great discoveries in
this field of chemistry are not far distant, which will recall with
wondering surprise the now universally exploded fallacies of the
&ldquo;Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Universal
Solvent.&rdquo; Indeed, we may find in the electrical energies of the
planets and the self-repulsive force of the electrospheres of the earth
and moon possible grounds for investigating anew some of the abandoned
tenets of astrology, in the hope that the light of science may disclose
some basis, at least, for what, at one time,&mdash;and for nearly all
time, in fact,&mdash;was the universally accepted belief, not only of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>ignorant, but of those the wisest and most
learned of their day and generation. If the planets by their position
can cloud the sun, nearly a million miles in diameter, with spots, or
shed the brilliance of the aurora borealis over all our skies, may they
not also cloud the embryonic intellect, or charge it with energies for
a career of prosperity or of disaster? May not the unseen currents, or
the electric storms around us, or the vast electrical phenomena of the
sun as well affect the sprouting germs of the husbandman or some
abnormally rapid development of an insect pest as the light, the
warmth, the moisture, or the cold, which, to our coarser vision, are
alone apparent? Fancy and fallacy revel luxuriantly where science
fails, but truth existed long before science was systematized, and the
supercilious condemnation of once generally accepted views without
examination is merely pseudo-science, and scarcely a single grade
higher in the scale than ignorant superstition itself. And every new
advance in knowledge requires a new overhauling of abandoned material,
just as a new advance in metallurgical knowledge enables us sometimes
to work over again our once-rejected mining dumps with decided profit.
Indeed, science itself is but a collection of observed facts reduced to
system, and among the shrewd and practical miners there is a well-known
saying, &ldquo;The ore is where you find it,&rdquo; which has
frequently put scientific assertion to the blush.</p>

<p>A study of the beautiful mezzotint plates, from the drawings of the
Earl of Rosse, contained in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href=
"#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>Professor Nichol&rsquo;s splendid
work, &ldquo;The Architecture of the Heavens,&rdquo; will clearly
disclose the forms, as revealed by a powerful telescope, of many of
these gaseous nebul&aelig;. Of such nebul&aelig;, Appleton&rsquo;s
Cyclop&aelig;dia says, &ldquo;nebul&aelig; proper, or those which have
not been definitely resolved, are found in nearly every quarter of the
firmament, though abounding especially near those regions which have
fewest stars. Scarcely any are found near the Milky Way, and the great
mass of them lie in the two opposite spaces farthest removed from this
circle. Their forms are very various, and often undergo strange and
unexpected changes as the power of the telescope with which they are
viewed is increased, so as not to be recognizable in some cases as the
same objects.&rdquo; An example of this is shown in Plate X. (Figs. 1
and 2) of Professor Nichol&rsquo;s work, which gives a greatly enlarged
view of those shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of Plate IX. (For Fig. 2 of
Nichol&rsquo;s Plate X., see illustration of nebula with double sun, in
previous chapter.) Professor Nichol says, &ldquo;In every instance
examined, save one, the planetary nebul&aelig; are nebul&aelig; with
hollow centers.&rdquo; The inference which this writer makes, that such
a planetary nebula consists of &ldquo;a grand annular cluster of
stars,&rdquo; has been since disproved by the discoveries of the
spectroscope, but the telescopic form remains true, and still awaits
further interpretation. While the irresolvable nebul&aelig; seem to
seek some retired spot in space for their processes, like certain
animals when incubating, this rule is not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>universal. Of this,
Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia says, &ldquo;The density of nebular
distribution increased with the distance from the galactic zone <i>for
the irresolvable nebul&aelig;</i>, but diminished with that distance
for the clusters&#8202;&hellip;. There is not a gradual condensation of
nebul&aelig; towards two opposite regions, near the poles of the
galactic zone, but the nebul&aelig; are gathered into streams, nodules,
and irregular aggregations such as we find in the grouping of
stars&#8202;&hellip;. Between stars and nebul&aelig; their arrangement
follows the law of contrast. There are two remarkable exceptions to
this law,&mdash;the Magellanic Clouds. In these, where stars of all
orders, from the ninth magnitude to irresolvable stellar aggregations,
are as richly gathered as in the galactic zone, nebul&aelig; of all
orders are also gathered richly, even more so than anywhere else over
the whole heavens.&rdquo; In the same work, article
&ldquo;Nebula,&rdquo; it is stated of the planetary nebul&aelig;,
&ldquo;There are several which have perfectly the appearance of a ring,
and are called annular nebul&aelig;&#8202;&hellip;. Some appear to be
physically connected in pairs like double stars. Most of the small
nebul&aelig; have the general appearance of a bright central nucleus
enveloped in a nebulous veil. This nucleus is sometimes concentrated as
a star and sometimes diffused. The enveloping veil is sometimes
circular and sometimes elliptical, with every degree of eccentricity
between a circle and a straight line. There are some which, with a
general disposition to symmetry of form, have great branching arms or
filaments with more or less precision of outline. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>An
example of this is Lord Rosse&rsquo;s Crab nebula. Another remarkable
object is the nebula in Andromeda, which is visible with the naked eye,
and is the only one which was discovered before the invention of the
telescope. Simon Marius (1612) describes its appearance as that of a
candle shining through horn. Besides the above, which have
comparatively regular forms, there are others more diffused and devoid
of symmetry of shape. A remarkable example is the great nebula in
Orion, discovered by Huygens in 1656&#8202;&hellip;. The great nebula
in Argo is another example of this class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The number of nebul&aelig; recognized in all the heavens is upward
of five thousand, and new ones are being constantly discovered. Of
these objects, Professor Nichol says, &ldquo;The spiral figure is
characteristic of an extensive class of galaxies. Majestic associations
of orbs, arranged in this winding form, with branches issuing like a
divergent geometric curve from a globular cluster.&rdquo; These
nebul&aelig;, however, are not associations of orbs; they are gaseous
nebul&aelig; apparently in process of evolution. This author (Professor
Nichol) presents views of such spiral nebul&aelig; either foreshortened
to the view, so as to form a long ellipse, or with the convolutions of
the spiral apparently raised from the horizontal plane into a conical
form, and showing the black streaks of space which lie between the
convolutions, others seen in side view, others in front, and, in fact,
presented to the eye in every position for observation. The author
wrote before the days of the spectroscope, and that he should
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>conceive these vast objects to be spirals made
up of blazing suns like our Milky Way&mdash;vast galaxies, in
fact&mdash;was an inevitable conclusion at that time; but we now know
that these spiral nebul&aelig; are gaseous, are apparently in process
of manufacture, and we can see them in their different stages of
evolution, and may perhaps learn something about the processes by which
solar systems and galaxies of suns are formed. Of one of these strange
but exceedingly instructive objects, Professor Ball, in his work
&ldquo;In the High Heavens,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;Fig. 3 represents one
of the famous spiral nebul&aelig; (that of Canes Venatici) discovered
many years ago by the late Earl of Rosse. The object is invisible to
the naked eye. It seems like a haze surrounding the stars, which the
telescope discloses in considerable numbers, as shown in the picture.
When viewed through an instrument of sufficient power, a marvellous
spectacle is revealed. There are wisps and patches of glowing
cloud-like material which shine not as our clouds do, by reflecting to
us the sunlight. This celestial cloud is no doubt self-luminous; it is,
in fact, composed of vapors so intensely heated that they glow with
fervor. As I write, I have Lord Rosse&rsquo;s elaborate drawing of this
nebula before me, and on the margin of this stupendous object the
nebula fades away so tenderly that it is almost impossible to say where
the luminosity terminates. Probably this nebula will in some remote age
condense down into more solid substances. It contains, no doubt, enough
material to make many globes as big as our earth. Before, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>however, it settles down into dark bodies like
the earth, it will have to pass through stages in which its condensing
materials will form bright sun-like bodies. It seems as if this process
of condensation might almost be witnessed at the present time in some
parts of the great object. There are also some very striking
nebul&aelig; which are often spoken of as <i>planetary</i>. They are
literally balls of bluish-colored gas or vapor, apparently more dense
than that which forms the nebula now under consideration. Such globes
are doubtless undergoing condensation, and may be regarded as incipient
worlds.&rdquo; Of these spiral nebul&aelig; it is said, in
Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia, &ldquo;Many of them had been long
known as nebul&aelig;, but their characteristic spiral form had never
been suspected. They have the appearance of a maelstrom of stellar
matter, and are among the most interesting objects in the
heavens.&rdquo; Of their spectra it is said, &ldquo;The bright-line
spectrum is given by all the irregular nebul&aelig; hitherto examined
and by the planetary nebul&aelig;.&rdquo; That is to say, these
nebul&aelig; are gaseous in constitution, and have not yet reached the
stage of solar condensation which marks the existence of individual
suns. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=

<p class="first">While the nebular theory of Laplace is now the
generally accepted scientific hypothesis of the formation of our solar
system and of all solar systems, it finds its strongest support in the
mode in which it seeks to account for the heat and light of the
sun,&mdash;that is, that the central orb, gradually condensing down
from an original volume as large as the orbit of Neptune, at least,
after disengaging the planetary rings, continued to condense to its
present volume, and still so continues, the molecular motions arrested
by condensation under gravity reappearing in the form of the energy of
light and heat, and that this process of degradation will continue
until, finally, the sun becomes a solid inert mass, incapable by
further condensation of exciting the ethereal undulations in space
which constitute heat and light, when the whole process will finally
cease, the sun will die out, the planets continue to rotate in
darkness, and the whole machinery be left running through an eternal
night, like a vast mill in the hands of a negligent watchman (or rather
no watchman at all), left to run <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269"
href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>itself alone, dark, empty,
lifeless, and deserted, through the long and silent watches of the
night. While the source and mode of solar energy set forth in this work
are to be as readily accounted for if we accept as valid
Laplace&rsquo;s nebular hypothesis as by any other theory, yet such
basis is not essential for its support; for while the planetary
rotations and the central sun are the necessary consequence, according
to Laplace&rsquo;s hypothesis, of their mode of formation,&mdash;are,
in fact, just what we actually find them to be under any
hypothesis,&mdash;electrical generation and transformation will proceed
just the same whether the planets and sun were formed originally in one
mode or in another. But, since this generally accepted hypothesis
accounts for the light and heat of the sun, to a certain extent at
least, and for a certain relatively brief period, while no other
hypothesis has been able to sufficiently account for it at all, and
while this hypothesis also finds both support and contradiction in many
observed phenomena of our solar system, it may well occur that this
hypothesis itself, based upon the necessity of accounting for the
sun&rsquo;s light and heat, and which latter afford it its strongest
basis of support, may, if the basis upon which the theory rests be
found to be otherwise explicable, still remain as an end, while
originally presented only as a means, and thus be held as an obstacle
to the acceptance of the widely different interpretation of known facts
herein presented, in the absence of any other hypothesis capable of
explaining the same facts in accordance with this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>presentation of planetary electrical generation
and the solar transformation of this energy into light and heat.
Herbert Spencer mentions an instance of such perversion of means into
an end as occurring during the agitation for the repeal of the corn
laws in England, which extended over many years, during which organized
efforts were made to influence Parliament. A permanent commission was
established, with official head-quarters permanently located in London,
with clerks, secretaries, higher officers, and all the paraphernalia of
a first-class establishment. The purpose of this institution was to act
in behalf of the popular interests upon Parliament by every available
means to secure this great reform. After years of effort, he says, a
clerk one day rushed, breathless, into the office from the House of
Commons and shouted, in accents of despair, &ldquo;We are ruined; the
bill has passed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nebular hypothesis, while generally accepted in lieu of a better
one, has no actual primary basis beyond that of mere assumption. Of it
Professor Ball says, &ldquo;The nebular theory &hellip; seems, from the
nature of the case, to be almost incapable of receiving any direct
testimony.&rdquo; We have already quoted from Professor Newcomb that it
must be accepted, with all its difficulties, until a different and
sufficient explanation of solar energy shall be presented. As set forth
in Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia, the theory is as follows:
&ldquo;<i>Assuming, for the sake of the argument</i>, a rare,
homogeneous, nebulous matter, widely diffused through space, the
following successive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"
name="pb271">271</a>]</span>changes will, on physical principles, take
place in it: 1, mutual gravitation of its atoms; 2, atomic repulsion;
3, evolution of heat by overcoming this repulsion; 4, molecular
combination at a certain stage of condensation; followed by, 5, sudden
and great disengagement of heat; 6, lowering of temperature by
radiation and consequent precipitation of binary atoms, aggregating
into irregular flocculi and floating in the rarer medium, just as water
when precipitated from air collects into clouds; 7, each flocculus will
move towards the common center of gravity of all; but, being an
irregular mass in a resisting medium, this motion will be out of the
rectilinear,&mdash;that is to say, not directly towards the common
center of gravity, but towards one or the other side of it,&mdash;and
thus, 8, a spiral movement will ensue, which will be communicated to
the rarer medium through which the flocculus is moving; and, 9, a
preponderating momentum and rotation of the whole mass in some one
direction, <i>converging</i> in spirals towards the common center of
gravity. Certain subordinate actions are to be noticed also. Mutual
attraction will tend to produce groups of flocculi concentrating around
local centers of gravity and acquiring a subordinate vortical movement.
These conclusions are shown to be in entire harmony with the observed
phenomena. In this genetic process, when the precipitated matter is
aggregating into flocculi, there will be found here and there detached
portions, like shreds of cloud in a summer sky, which will not coalesce
with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>larger internal masses, but will slowly follow
without overtaking them. These fragments will assume characteristics of
motion strikingly correspondent to those of the comets, whose physical
constitution and distribution are seen to be completely accordant with
the hypothesis.&rdquo; During this process, it is further stated,
successive rings of nebulous matter will be thrown off and left behind,
which are supposed to have coalesced into planets and their satellites,
and the motion of rotation will become more and more rapid as
condensation proceeds, until, finally, the last planet, Mercury, will
be left behind in annular form, and the sun will then become the
central orb of all the planets, and condensation afterwards will
proceed without further delivery of planetary rings. Professor Ball
says, &ldquo;If we go sufficiently far back, we seem to come to a time
when the sun, in a more or less completely gaseous state, filled up the
surrounding space out to the orbit of Mercury, or, earlier still, out
to the orbit of the remotest planet.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Great spiral nebula in Canes Venatici. (See Fig. 156
of Guillemin&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Heavens.&rdquo;) The small nebula to
the right is also, according to M. Chacarnac, a spiral, though with the
telescopic power used the figure above does not show it.</p>
</div>
<p>There is nothing in the actively developing nebula illustrated on
the following page which shows the slightest analogy, either in
structure or the forces at work, to what is demanded by the nebular
hypothesis. On the contrary, these radiating, spiral convolutions,
springing from a center and extended, with interstratified dark spaces,
out to the periphery, are entirely incompatible with that theory. There
have not, so far, been observed in all the heavens any gaseous
nebul&aelig; which lend the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href=
"#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>slightest support to the nebular
hypothesis. We should expect to find, if it were true, that many of the
nucleated planetary nebul&aelig; show exterior concentric rings of
luminous matter, clearly defined, two, three, or a dozen in number,
left behind by the contracting volume of the nebula, and coalescing
into planets, and, within, the glowing disk from which new external
rings are about to be left as a residuum. On the contrary, these
nebul&aelig; gradually fade away towards their margins, and
imperceptibly disappear in the blackness of space. If they terminated
abruptly, we might suppose that here, at <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>least, was the orbit
of a newly forming planet, but the regular and delicate gradation of
luminosity from maximum to zero shows that no such sudden breaking off
has occurred. In all these nebul&aelig; we find every definitely marked
structure to exhibit the operation of combined forces of gravity and
internal repulsion nearly equally balanced, but each acting
independently of the other. These phenomena are as universal as the
forces of cohesion and repellent polarity in the &ldquo;attraction
particles&rdquo; of cell-life which determine the segmentation, growth,
and development of the living organism. We find here the primal
modification and differentiation of material structure under the stress
of directly opposite and interacting primitive forces, and it is
doubtless the same whether in a cell or a system. It is not a residuum,
but the <i>vis a tergo</i>.</p>
<p>It is well known that there are many and great difficulties involved
in the nebular hypothesis. As for the genesis of comets, it will be at
once seen that the theory will only account for such comets as never
venture much beyond the orbit of Neptune, as well as those which have
an orbital plane nearly coincident with that of the planets. But most
comets come from illimitable space, far, far beyond Neptune&rsquo;s
circle and at all angles to the plane of the planetary orbits; and we
have already seen that a disk of space of the diameter of
Neptune&rsquo;s orbit and half as thick (see Proctor&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Familiar Essays&rdquo;) would, to contain all the matter of our
solar system equally distributed, have a density of only one
four-hundred-thousandth that of hydrogen gas at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>atmospheric pressure,&mdash;that is to say, such
a volume of the lightest substance we know of would make four hundred
thousand solar systems like our own. This author inquires if such a
mass could, under any circumstances, rotate as a whole, and adds,
&ldquo;Has it ever occurred, I often wonder, to those who glibly quote
the nebular theory as originally propounded, to inquire how far some of
the processes suggested by Laplace are in accordance with the now
well-known laws of physics?&rdquo; But the great primal difficulty is
in the first assumption of the theory, which is not only entirely
gratuitous, but physically impossible. It is that this great plasma of
nebulous material&mdash;in the case of our own solar system not less
than six thousand million miles in diameter&mdash;should have in
someway become aggregated into a homogeneous mass of the requisite
tenuity, complete and perfect, and ready for the succeeding stages of
the process, in which, however, the law of gravity has hitherto had no
active operation whatever; for, if gravitation existed and operated
therein, such homogeneous mass could never have been formed, nor ever
existed even if formed. The very forces which alone could have brought
this vast mass together must have been the identical forces which
afterwards broke it up into the sun and planets, and the operation of
the same force must have prevented its original formation at all.
According to the theory, it was like a horse-race, in which all the
participants stood silent and motionless until the judge cried,
&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; But the judge was the great creative force itself,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>and if the fiat reached to this extent, the same
power could just as readily&mdash;nay, far more readily&mdash;have shot
the sun and planets forth into rotation, as children scatter
dough-balls, instead of holding in abeyance the control of universal
law so as to (as a humorous writer speaks of the operations of a child
in his investigation of a watch) &ldquo;see the wheels go round.&rdquo;
This is not nature&rsquo;s plan, so far as human knowledge goes. Of
course these masses gathering to this great nebulous center, if acted
upon by gravitation, would have at once condensed around the center as
a nucleus, and if rotation ever commenced, it must have commenced then,
millions of years, doubtless, before the outlying masses had even got
within hailing distance. When masses of people assemble at a
camp-meeting, the first comers take the best places, and the late
arrivals have to circulate around in the woods; they do not all gather
in a circle and then make a grand rush. That would be fair, perhaps,
but it is not nature. And this, unquestionably, is how, if ever formed
at all, these nebul&aelig; must have formed into systems.</p>
<p>The fact that the orbital planes of very many of these asteroids are
greatly inclined to the common planetary plane, and still more greatly
inclined to one another, points almost unerringly to the existence
during their stage of formation of some powerful force either of
internal repulsion or external attraction. That no sufficiently large
body could have been present to exercise such attraction so far outside
the general planetary plane is self-evident, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>if
there had been such source of attraction, while the orbital planes of
the asteroids might have been deflected from the common plane, they
could not have been forced apart so as to differ largely among
themselves. Certainly nothing pertaining to the nebular hypothesis
could have produced any such effects under any conceivable
circumstances, and especially at so late a period of its progress,
after all the principal planets had been completed. The only
alternative is self-repulsion, and this could only have been due to the
causes and their mode of operation already described in this work. In a
modified degree these planes exhibit the same irregular orbital
deflections as are so conspicuously visible in the orbits of comets,
and they must have been unquestionably produced in the same manner. The
barren bands or stripes in the area occupied by these asteroids, like
the dark or vacant rings of the planet Saturn, may have been largely
affected by the perturbing attraction of the neighboring planet
Jupiter; but certainly no influence of that great planet (himself in
the common planetary plane) could have operated to cast these forming
planetoids into planes of diverse inclinations among themselves or to
that of his own. On the contrary, his whole force must have been
exerted to bring them into the closest harmony with his own orbital
movements.</p>
<p>Omitting discussion of the technical difficulties in the application
of the nebular theory to demonstrated facts, which may be found in the
books, we may again repeat that this theory is not essential to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>account for the heat of the sun, which finds its
real source elsewhere, while, nevertheless, the theory in itself is not
incompatible with the views which we have endeavored to present and
demonstrate. Certain phenomena, however, have been considered in prior
quotations in this work which may aid us to roughly indicate the
successive processes by which the evolution of solar systems and
galaxies may be explained on another basis which requires no violent
assumptions to be made and no suspension of any of nature&rsquo;s
universal laws. The same operations which we see around us at the
present time in our own system, if extended to the dimensions of a
nebular aggregation, would probably present the same phenomena as those
we find partially disclosed in the gaseous nebul&aelig;, particularly
the spiral, and these would naturally determine the final production of
solar systems such as our own. The gaseous nebul&aelig;, not spiral,
and the mixed nebul&aelig; also, would fall into their appropriate
categories in the same general plan, and a consistent mode of formation
would be presented from the beginning to the end of the different
processes.</p>

</div>
<p>It should be observed that the spiral required by Laplace&rsquo;s
nebular theory is essentially a centripetal spiral. The spiral
nebul&aelig; we see in the heavens, however, are <i>centrifugal</i>
spirals. This is clearly shown in Plates XV., XII., and the
frontispiece of Nichol&rsquo;s &ldquo;Architecture of the
Heavens,&rdquo; as well as in Plates XIII. and XIV. Plate XV.&mdash;the
open spiral&mdash;is directly contradictory of any phenomena which
could occur in accordance with the nebular <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>theory of Laplace. The frontispiece shows the
only form which such a nebula could assume at any stage of its
career,&mdash;that is, a close spiral with nearly circular
convolutions. But while this particular form is not only in entire
accordance with the hypothesis which we are about to suggest,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>being in fact one of the later and necessary
stages in its progress, any such spiral as that shown in Plate XV. is
utterly out of the question in the application of the nebular theory of
Laplace or in any of the more recent modifications thereof.</p>
<p>The only hypothesis by which the various phenomena can be adequately
explained must almost certainly be based upon the combined action of
gravitation and electrospheric repulsion. We find in the corona of our
own sun such phenomena manifested in the most striking degree, even in
a completed system, and we can well understand that during the early
stages of systemic development such phenomena would vastly transcend
anything which we could now hope to observe around our own sun. We see
this repulsion still more highly developed in the formation of the
tails of comets. While these coronal rays are not visible to a distance
of more, perhaps, than five million miles from the sun&rsquo;s disk, we
have seen that the tail of Newton&rsquo;s comet was shot forth to a
distance of ninety million miles in a few days, as it were in a moment,
by the tremendous electrical repulsion of the solar electrosphere, and
that this enormous tail, which, if composed of hydrogen gas alone (it
was, of course, enormously more attenuated), would have contained a
mass much more than equal to the weight of the sun, was swung around
over an arc of one hundred and eighty degrees, giving a radial sweep of
the tail over a distance of two hundred and eighty millions of miles in
less than four days. And the tails of many other comets have largely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>transcended in dimensions that of Newton, above
cited. We have learned much of the laws which regulate the development
of storms, cyclones, whirlwinds, water-spouts, and other vortical
phenomena in the atmosphere of our own earth, and can readily apply
these principles to phenomena of vastly greater magnitude. We know that
the matter of comets&rsquo; tails is self-repulsive, as shown in
multiple tails, as well as that it is repelled by an adjacent similarly
electrified electrosphere,&mdash;that of the sun, for example,&mdash;as
with pith-balls in the familiar class-room experiments; so that we can
gather a very fair and complete idea of the processes of nature when
dealing with such phenomena on a vastly more extended scale, in which
our moments are measured by millions of years and our miles by the
almost infinite distances of sidereal and nebular space. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The processes of development of a solar system from
the diffused elemental matter of space may then be roughly sketched as
follows, premising that each stage may have possibly extended over vast
periods of time, and the whole, perhaps, not been completed for
millions of years. With the processes of creation time is as
nothing.</p>
<p>The area of space in which a solar system is about to be developed
has hitherto maintained its molecular constituents in a state of
gradually increased unstable equilibrium, whether such augmented
instability may have been induced by a gradual rise of temperature from
emission of the solar energy of other galaxies, by gradual diffusion
from constantly operative centers, from currents or vortices of space,
or by some primal inherent constitution of space itself, with
constantly increasing tensions relieved by successive discharges, of
which analogous instances are found in various other processes of
nature, as, for example, ovulation, fission, and gemmation in the
reproduction of life, regularly recurring epileptiform convulsions,
regularly repeated spark discharges from electrical machines, or the
ebullition of viscous fluids with their slowly recurring bursting
bubbles. At some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283"
name="pb283">283</a>]</span>focal point of this area a rupture of
tension will finally occur, induced by some sudden current or vortical
movement, as we see sometimes in a pool of water gradually reduced in
temperature below the freezing-point, when its whole surface, by the
passage of a breath of wind even, will be suddenly flashed into
crystals of ice. At this point of space there will be instituted a
rapid expansion among the molecules and a consequent fall of
temperature, followed by an inrush of the vaporous material surrounding
this center of agitation, and a vortical movement will be established,
with currents of spatial matter attracted to this vortex in constantly
increasing streams. The molecular tensions will be successively
unlocked as the circles of agitation continue to widen, and a condensed
nucleus will form, rotating upon its axis and exhibiting the combined
phenomena of gravity and centrifugal force. As the nucleus continues to
increase in mass and density its temperature will constantly rise,
while its speed of rotation will gradually diminish as its volume
increases, and the aqueous vapors of space, as they gather around this
rotating center of attraction, will be forced outward by centrifugal
action and the heat of the nucleus, and form vast attenuated
clouds,&mdash;not necessarily visible, however, to human
sight,&mdash;and these clouds, in their various stratifications and
disturbances, will gradually come to partake of the rotatory movement
of the center, such movements, however, gradually fading away as they
recede in space and in density. The cyclonic movements of these clouds
of aqueous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>vapor upon themselves, but principally against
the surrounding gases of space still under tension, will generate
enormous quantities of electricity, which flash like thunder-clouds as
they approach each other, with incessant streams of lightning and rolls
of thunder. The growing and heating central nucleus is thus thrown into
a state of high electrical opposite polarity, and its own constituent
elements become self-repellent, just as we see in the sun&rsquo;s
corona and in the phenomena of comets. The electrical tension of the
central mass will gradually grow higher and higher, until a vast stream
or streams of incandescent nebulous matter (for with double suns they
may be multiple, or the internal repulsion may even cause division of
the nucleus itself) will be suddenly driven outward in a radial
direction along the lines of least resistance,&mdash;that is to say, in
the plane of equatorial rotation, where centrifugal force is most
effective. We can readily understand the self-repellent force of such
an enormous mass of cosmical matter by considering that, in our own
completed system, the repulsion of the solar electrosphere drove forth
the tail of Newton&rsquo;s comet, as before stated, to a distance of
ninety million miles, and whirled it around a semicircle of this radius
in less than four days. Our most distant planet, Neptune, is only
thirty times this distance from the sun, and we see during every solar
eclipse the coronal structure glowing to a distance of more than a
million miles from the sun&rsquo;s disk, and the radial streamers
driven forth five million miles, and even farther. (See illustrations
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>of solar corona in Guillemin&rsquo;s &ldquo;The
Heavens.&rdquo;) The vast stream of radiating nebulous matter thus
forced out by solar repulsion will likewise be acted upon with equal
energy by its own internal self-repellent force. If we conceive a
stream of water thrown vertically upward by a powerful force-pump, in
which every drop of the fluid is endowed with tremendous self-repulsive
energy, we should find an analogy to the phenomenon in question. We can
see an example of this in the &ldquo;Crab Nebula,&rdquo; illustrated in
a previous chapter. The stream, acted upon by gravity downward, by the
force of ejection upward, and by the internal force of repulsion both
transversely and upward, would assume a pyriform shape, narrower
beneath, largely swollen about its middle, and thence gradually
decreasing in diameter to its termination in a rounded tuft, in advance
of which would be driven forth detached sprays and wisps, while
filaments and outlying parallel strands would mark its entire ascent,
except towards its point of ejection, where the primal force which
drove it out is greatly in excess of those of gravity and
self-repulsion. It will be seen at a glance that these phenomena are
precisely those which we observe in a comet&rsquo;s tail. (See
illustrations of many comets having these characteristics in
Guillemin&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Heavens,&rdquo; Lockyer&rsquo;s
edition.)</p>
<p>Suppose, now, that this stream of water or the tail of a large comet
were gradually wrapped around its point of emission by the rotation of
this nucleus upon its axis. A spiral would form, very open or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>flaring at first, but gradually growing closer
and more circular as the force of gravity drew its convolutions
downward upon the interstratified clouds of aqueous vapor occupying, in
compressed layers, the spaces between the adjacent coils of the spiral.
There would be a composite action of forces observed: gravity would
attract the convolutions and their interstratified layers of cloud
equally, according to their densities, while the central repulsive
force would repel the convolutions of the spiral along the same lines
of force, but would not act at all upon the strata of clouds, and the
force of internal self-repulsion would also tend to disrupt the
convolutions of the spiral by expanding them outwardly. The outer
convolution, however, would have no backward thrust from any internal
repulsion beyond, while, within, gravity and solar repulsion would be
more equally balanced, so that the outer coil would be relatively
compressed in its rotation against the next inner convolution, and its
ratio of distance would not be maintained. We find this exemplified in
the case of Neptune&rsquo;s, orbit in our own system. The inner
convolution would also be abnormal, since the primal force of ejection
must have been sufficient to carry the outward thrust of the whole
spiral, and in consequence its flare would offer much greater
resistance to the deflection of rotation, and it would have a more
radial direction than those beyond. We shall find that the planet
Mercury, and the inner convolution which was eventually reabsorbed into
the solar mass, exhibit these phenomena. Between the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>outer and these inner convolutions the curve of
the spiral would be approximately regular, with a fixed ratio of
increase. In the planets of our solar system this ratio is that
produced by constantly doubling the preceding number, the series being
0, 3, 6, 12, 24, etc. In other solar systems, however, the ratio may be
quite different. In this abnormal flare of the inner convolution is
doubtless to be found the rational basis of Bode&rsquo;s empirical law
of planetary distances, in which the arbitrary number 4 must be added
to each term of the above progression, making the series 4, 7, 10, 16,
28, etc. The inner coil between Mercury and the sun was drawn into the
solar mass on the disruption of the spiral, leaving, from the
abnormally radial curvature of the inner portions of the spiral and its
absence from the series, a vacant place which must be represented by
the relatively fixed increment to be added to each term of the
series.</p>
<p>As the convolutions of the spiral become more and more compressed
towards each other and more and more flattened against the
interstratified cloud-layers, the force of internal repulsion becomes
more and more active in its tendency to disrupt the spiral, since its
forces are more direct and concentrated along lines nearly at right
angles to the force of gravity. During the formation of the spiral we
can easily conceive that&mdash;like a stream of water shooting over a
cascade, or the multiple tails of some comets, or even a whole comet,
as, for example, Biela&rsquo;s, which was split up into two separate
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>bodies by this force&mdash;some convolution,
perhaps a single one of the series, will be laterally divided into a
large number of nearly parallel strands, mutually held apart by their
internal self-repulsion, and with cloud-layers interposed between these
lateral strands. Such a series of small planets as these would finally
produce we find in the belt of our asteroids, the bulk of the
convolution, probably, for the most part, however, scattered in space,
since their aggregate mass is so small, and possibly, in part,
coalesced into the mass of Jupiter, to which Mars, by his position, may
also have contributed.</p>
<div class="figure p288width" id="p288"><img src="images/p288.jpg" alt=

external ring split and held apart by electrical self-repulsion. (From
Helmholtz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Popular Lectures.&rdquo;)</p>
</div>
<p>Not only may a whole convolution be thus split up, but along the
spiral at many points the outer margins may be thrust outward, forming
partially detached parallel strands, which may thus coalesce
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>to form the satellites of the completed planets;
while at the outer extremity of all, where the backward thrust of
self-repulsion is wanting, enormous wisps, sprays, and tufts of
nebulous matter would be driven entirely forth into the illimitable
realms of outer space, but not necessarily, or even <span class="corr"
id="xd26e2253" title="Source: prob-bly">probably</span>, into the space
of other systems, which are so enormously distant; and there, in those
unoccupied realms, they will remain to gyrate &ldquo;in the solitude of
their own originality,&rdquo; in the form of comets, until, at long
intervals, they may chance to revisit the scenes of their earliest
youth, to warm their frozen limbs for a brief period at the old and
well-remembered parental fire, or finally, worn out with toil and
travel, &ldquo;come home at last to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driven forth from the society of their fellows by their own
unbalanced energies, these anarchists of the sky may form loose
aggregations, granulated about multitudes of self-constituted minor
centers; but, cut loose from all effective solar control during their
period of coalescence, they must forever lack the consolidated form and
complex organization of their prosperous and rotund brethren, the
planets and their satellites, or even the tiny asteroids, who stayed
home and, like the little pig, had bread and butter for breakfast.</p>
<p>The disruptive energy of internal repulsion, as above stated,
increases in force as the convolutions of the spiral become more and
more compressed and the spiral becomes more and more circular in form.
Suddenly the coils of the spiral will be burst asunder, and this will
occur along that particular <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href=
"#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>radial line of gravitation where
the central nucleus acts with its most effective force. The disruption
will be simultaneous, as a general rule, in accordance with the
principles which control ruptures of tension of bodies in a state of
unstable equilibrium, and which we see exemplified in multiplied
centers of crystallization, the simultaneous formation of mud-cracks,
the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, and other like phenomena. Each convolution
will now become a detached open ring, one of its broken extremities,
however, being millions of miles farther from the central nucleus than
the other. What occurs when a cometic body, negatively electrified,
impinges upon the positive electrosphere of a planet, or when an
electrical induction machine like Voss&rsquo;s is touched by an
oppositely electrified body, will now necessarily occur with these
disrupted convolutions. Their connection with the negatively
electrified nucleus being broken, a reversal of electrical polarity
will ensue from contact with the adjacent positively electrified clouds
of aqueous vapor, and, instead of self-repulsion, mutual attraction
will now prevail along the length of each of the open rings. Held apart
from the central nucleus by the interstratified cloud-layers, and acted
upon by the double force of gravity and internal attraction, the
component elements of these open rings will rapidly lose their
luminosity and heat, and coalesce by a retrograde movement down the
lines of their direction, thus approaching the sun along the segment of
an ellipse, the nucleus, or sun, occupying one of the foci, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>eccentricity of the ellipse being measured by
the differential between the nearest point of the open ring and the
part of the convolution which lies directly opposite and beyond the
sun. In other words, the form of the spiral will determine the
eccentricity of the ellipse, subject to perturbations, however, of
various sorts. During this stage of coalescence from an open ring into
a sphere, these bodies will take on, by cooling and condensation, their
planetary forms; and as the forming spheres, by the retreat of their
masses down the lines of approach to the sun, advance, their forward
and nearer extremities will be more powerfully acted upon by gravity
than those parts in the rear, and a forward plunge or axial movement of
rotation will be set up. Viscous matter,&mdash;pitch, for
example,&mdash;molten by the sun&rsquo;s heat and flowing down a steep
roof, exhibits a similar forward movement, the outer layers tending to
roll over the inner ones in convoluted folds, the adhesion to the roof
of the under surface corresponding to the retarding pull of the
sun&rsquo;s attraction. In like manner are produced rotating eddies in
streams of water having crooked channels, eddies of air under
water-falls, and other analogous atmospheric disturbances. During the
stage of coalescence of the planetary spheres the adjacent clouds of
aqueous vapor will condense around them, and their hitherto diffused
electrical energies will be concentrated by rotation in <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e2264" title="Source: curents">currents</span> of
enormous quantity and potential directly upon the sun, and a
disassociation of the elements which compose these watery vapors will
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>ensue, the result of which will be the deposit
of hydrogen gas as an atmospheric envelope around the sun&rsquo;s body,
and of oxygen around and through the bodies which constitute the
planets. These gases will be disassociated in their combining
proportions, two volumes of hydrogen at the sun for one volume of
oxygen, distributed according to their relative electrical energies
among the planets. This nascent oxygen will rapidly combine with the
consolidating elements of the planets and, interpenetrating their
solidifying bodies, form the vast mass of oxides which we find to
constitute the bulk of our terrestrial mass, the residue, mechanically
commingled with the condensed ever-present nitrogen, forming the
planetary atmospheres. The condensation of volume of the planets will
give rise to great elevation of temperature, while their currents of
electricity, poured into the sun, will, by their passage through its
enormously compressed hydrogen atmosphere, produce intense heat, and
this, rapidly communicated to the solar core within, will raise its
temperature to that of the sun as we now see it, and permanently
maintain it in that state of incandescence.</p>
<p>During the stage of coalescence of the planetary bodies, outlying
strands of the spiral will follow the course of their adjacent masses
in a nearly parallel movement, and will gradually coalesce into smaller
bodies more directly under the influence of the gravity of their own
adjacent planets, by their proximity, than of that of the sun. These
bodies will thus rotate as satellites around their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>planets, and the forward shift of their centers
of gravity, by their advance along their lines of coalescence, may
result in a permanent displacement, of which we see an example in the
moon, which constantly presents the same face to the earth, while
having an axial rotation of its own with reference to the sun. (In this
case the action of gravity may have been assisted, however, by the
mutual repulsion of the lunar and terrestrial electrospheres forcing
the atmosphere and moisture of the lunar mass to its opposite side and
maintaining it there, where it would remain as a buffer against
rotation.) In some cases we might find certain outlying strands of a
convolution which, perturbed by external influences, may have been
delayed in its conversion into spherical form, and this subordinate
strand, pyriform itself, as it must have been, in shape, would thus
form a spiral of minute discrete bodies, probably like the nucleus of a
comet, finally assuming the shape of a series of rings, and rotating
like a satellite around the neighboring planet, the inner and outer
strands more attenuated and the middle ones more condensed, as we find
to be the case with the rings of Saturn.</p>
<p>In the original spiral we have seen that, as a whole, it was of
necessity pyriform in shape. The planets formed therefrom would thus be
found to increase in size from within outward to a maximum, after which
they would again decrease, but not to the original minimum, while the
extreme outer planet would also be unduly enlarged by increment from
partially dissipated terminal filaments, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>gradually attracted
thereto from surrounding space. There is such an undue enlargement of
the planet Neptune, and this, with its relatively compressed orbit,
before alluded to, renders it almost certain that Neptune is in reality
the outermost member of our planetary system. We find this gradation of
size to be the case in our solar system, except where the series has
been broken by the multitudinous separation, from violent internal
repulsion, of one of the convolutions into parallel strands showing all
sorts of perturbations, this being the convolution which occupied the
region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and which, by the
coalescence of these numerous parallel strands into small planetary
bodies, has filled the space with a belt of asteroids hundreds and
perhaps thousands or even tens of thousands in number. It is probable
that a law regulating the ellipticity of planetary orbits can be
deduced from a consideration of the principles which have governed
their inception, and with these are doubtless closely related those
laws of Laplace which have demonstrated that &ldquo;in any system of
bodies travelling in one direction around a central attracting orb, the
eccentricities and inclinations, if small at any one time, would always
continue inconsiderable.&rdquo; (Appleton&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia,
article &ldquo;Planet.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>We have thus traced the genesis of a solar system from its earliest
stages forward through its various changes until, complete and in
working order, it is ready to be sent on its eternal course, either
alone or as one of a vast congeries of similar <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>systems, like the Milky Way. (See frontispiece
for illustration of a series of types of development from a
straight-tailed comet, through different curvatures, and spiral
nebul&aelig; of less and less divergence, until nearly circular, and
finally terminating in a complete solar system.) These processes of
creation may be isolated, or they may flash a hundred million solar
systems into being together, as crystals flash forth in the rock; but,
when once formed, they go forth each as eternal as space itself.</p>
<p>But can we not go back one step farther still in the progressive
stages of creative energy? Whence came these powerful agencies by means
of which all those distant regions became peopled with suns and worlds?
The great source of all is to be found alone in space,&mdash;the
so-called &ldquo;empty space.&rdquo; But it is far from empty; all
through it are diffused the attenuated vapors which, condensed,
constitute our suns and planets, and all that is, or ever shall be,
gaseous vapors, which are held poised, with their opposite tensions of
cohesion and expansion, like the Prince Rupert drops which
glass-blowers make for toys,&mdash;a little bulb of glass, chilled as
it falls, molten, in a vessel of water. From one extremity projects a
long, crooked stem, scarcely thicker at the end than a horse-hair, spun
out from the molten glass as it hung from the glass-blower&rsquo;s rod.
The bulbous body is as large, perhaps, as a nut; you can beat it with a
hammer and it will not break; it is the hardest in structure of all
glass. Now, wrap this bulb up in a thick <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>handkerchief, or you
may be injured; hold it firmly, and break off the very tiniest tip of
the long stem three, four, or even six inches from the bulb. There is a
sudden shock; open your handkerchief, and lo! instead of the solid
bulb, there is only a loose mass of white powder. If you put the bulb
in a heavy glass vessel full of water and break off the tip of the
tail, it will shatter the vessel into fragments. What is the
explanation?&mdash;it is, of course, well known&mdash;simply that the
molecules of glass were instantly arrested in their motion of
adjustment as the glass was suddenly chilled by the water, and the
molecular motion of shrinkage was arrested, leaving the individual
molecules under a tremendous strain of position in their endeavor to
reach their true places. They are rigidly fixed in this position of
unstable equilibrium, one balancing the other; but let a single
molecule be displaced,&mdash;a fragment so tiny that the eye can
scarcely see it,&mdash;and the molecules, thus thrown out of mutual
support against each other, must now rearrange themselves from the
ruptured rigid mass, and, like a row of stood-up bricks, each of which
thrusts the other forward, with a sudden explosive force the molecules
assume their true position of stable equilibrium, but it is at the cost
of the whole structure. To this same cause we owe the explosive force
of our gunpowder, nitroglycerin, and all explosives; the molecules are
held in unstable equilibrium, and the tension once relieved at a single
point, be it ever so infinitesimal, the molecules of the whole mass
rearrange themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297"
name="pb297">297</a>]</span>with explosive energy. Strange that so
harmless a substance as glycerin, by the mere replacement of an atom of
nitrogen gas, should develop the energy of dynamite under a trifling
molecular shock.</p>
<p>So, also, the aqueous and perhaps other vapors of all space,
attenuated though they be, and perhaps by reason of this very tenuity
itself, as shown by the experiments of Professor Crookes with
attenuated gases when acted upon by electricity, are held in the same
state of unstable equilibrium. We know the potency of this instability
from the terrific explosive combination of the gases which combine to
form aqueous vapor. We may again refer to one of the well-known
experiments of Professor Crookes with simple atmospheric air. Enclosed
in a cylindrical glass vessel, the electric spark passed freely; as it
became more rarefied under an air-pump, new phenomena appeared, until,
at a stage of high rarefaction, the molecules of these gases were
driven forward by the electric current with such energy as first to
raise the temperature of the opposite side of the cylinder to a red
heat, then to melt, and finally to perforate the glass. The explanation
is that the movements of closely aggregated molecules mutually
interfere with each other; as they gain elbow-room by being reduced in
number, they act with more directness, and consequently with more
force: it is the difference between men fighting in a crowded room and
out in an open field. It is possible that these molecular tensions of
space, by the ready unlocking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298"
href="#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>of the forces with which they
are charged, may even aid in the rotation of the planets by acting upon
their electrospheres in their drift through space, as charged
thunder-clouds react upon each other, or the molecules of atmospheric
air, in moderately high vacua, under electrical excitement, act upon
the walls of the containing vessel, as in the experiments of Professor
Crookes and others. The riddles of nature are like those of the
sphinx,&mdash;they have more than one meaning.</p>
<p>The tensions of the aggregated molecules of space are thus
counterbalanced only so long as all space is equally occupied and a
state of perfect quiescence exists in its every part. A molecular
disturbance in one part is immediately communicated to adjacent parts,
and finally to all. With the first movement, gravity asserts itself,
for gravity exists and must exist in all parts, and must actively
manifest itself whenever the perfect mutual balance of space is
disturbed and a center of energy developed, and co-ordinately with the
action of gravity begins that of electricity. Movements among the
molecules are converted into movement of mass; centripetal motion
begets condensation, this begets sensible heat and vortical movement;
then come the phenomena of electrical generation by moving contact with
the gases of space, then repulsion and disassociation of the elements
of the aqueous vapors, combination of simple into compound elements;
and, the balance once disturbed, the state of unstable equilibrium is
forever destroyed, and all space henceforth must exhibit constant
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>change. There are whole segments of space
absolutely blank, so far as visible systems are concerned, which seem
to have been exhausted, for the present &aelig;ons at least, to supply
material for the vast adjacent galaxies which extend along their
borders; see illustrations in Proctor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essays on
Astronomy,&rdquo; article &ldquo;Distribution of the
Nebul&aelig;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It need not be supposed that such stage of perfect and universal
quiescence ever existed in fact; it is like the Nirvana of the Buddhist
philosophers,&mdash;a subjective and not an objective condition. We can
have no knowledge of the existence, even, of material things, save from
their phenomena, the manifestation of interchanging forces, upon which
rests our threefold basis of knowledge, perception, cognition, and
comparison. We know nothing of matter, except as affected by internal
or external force, nor of force itself, except as it acts in one mode
or another upon matter. All beyond this is, for us, without form and
void.</p>
<p>Progressive change has always, doubtless, been the universal law of
creation, and the great ocean of space is, and ever has been, and ever
will be the highway through which perpetually plough the great caravels
which bear the fortunes of creative energy, laden with life and light
and heat, in their eternal progression. The creative impulse once
given, if it, too, was not primeval in the eternal past, must have gone
on from development to development, like the transmission of life, from
age to age and from realm to realm. &ldquo;The mills of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>gods grind slowly;&rdquo; in these vast areas
time is absolutely nothing; the processes we see are but as the dip of
a swallow&rsquo;s wing compared with an inconceivable futurity; but all
our energies, and all the energies of planets and suns and systems and
galaxies, and of whatever other and wider created forms may stretch
onward to infinity, came forth from the ocean of space, and to this
ocean all these energies continue to return again in ceaseless
circuit.</p>
<p>Can we indicate any relationship of periodicity for the genesis of
solar systems from space? There is a remarkable example of a somewhat
similar periodicity in organic life for the rupture of tensions, so
common that its analogous character and perfect regularity are scarcely
even thought of. Among the highest species of mammalia we find that, in
a state of health, whether resident of the heights of the Andes, the
deserts of Africa, the jungles of India, or the most densely populated
centers of London; among rich or poor, high or low, idle or
industrious, virtuous or vicious, ancient or modern, civilized or
barbarous, black, white, red, or yellow, the ovum of the mature female
rises to the surface of the ovary, and at intervals, almost uniform, of
twenty-eight days, organic excitement ensues, the enclosing vesicle is
ruptured, and the ovum escapes. The remarkable feature is not that
these processes continuously succeed each other; but that under such
diverse conditions and opposite circumstances, and with two separate
ovaries operating at the same time, simultaneously <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>or
successively, this almost miraculous interval of no more and no less
than twenty-eight days between the successive ruptures of tension and
their attendant phenomena, should constantly persist. For its ultimate
cause we must look back to the <i>vis a tergo</i> to which we have
already alluded; and there may be, and doubtless is, a similarly acting
remote cause which regulates the periodical development of solar
systems or of galaxies, periods of intense activity, followed by
intervals of exhaustion and recuperation, and again succeeded by
another period of activity, and so on perpetually, for space is
perpetual, infinite, and inexhaustible.</p>
<p>It will be observed that the processes above roughly sketched are
somewhat similar to those observed in the formation of so-called
water-spouts, which usually terminate in dissipation in the atmosphere,
or else in terrific thunder-storms, but which occasionally reach a
sufficient energy of rotation to spin their central nuclei down
towards, or even to, the surface of the sea, or, in desert regions, to
that of the ground. There is no analogy with the theoretical and
&ldquo;assumed&rdquo; primal mass of attenuated plasma of the nebular
theory, or with its slow initial rotation, with the successive casting
off of rings of nebulous matter. It may sometimes happen, however, that
the repulsive electrical energy of the central nucleus may throw off
its external envelopes with sufficient force to drive them entirely
beyond the effective limit of its attractive forces, as occurs in the
formation of embryonic comets as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302"
href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>above described; in such case
the nebula will be a variable one, with successively repeated
aggregations and successive outbursts, periodical like the active
stages of volcanoes; and, even when the nucleus has already presented a
continuous solar spectrum, its energies may be thus expended, or more
gradually, and finally dissipated like the electricity of a highly
charged Leyden jar exposed to a moist atmosphere.</p>
<p>As a bottle of strongly effervescing liquid may blow itself empty,
when suddenly opened, by the mutually repellent energy of its contained
molecules, so if such a phenomenon were manifested in a radial
direction from a central point, the repelled spray would show itself as
a nebulous ring with a hollow center. An example of this sort is shown
in the multiple-tailed &ldquo;Catherine-wheel&rdquo; nebula (Fig. 4 of
a previous illustration). If such an annular nebula should become
ruptured into two portions by internal repulsion, the electrical
polarity of the smaller fragment would be reversed, and the two arcs
would separately coalesce and consolidate into a sun and a single
planet, forming a solar system like that of Algol, which has been
already described. Otherwise, the nebula would probably retrograde and
disappear, by diffusion, into space again. We may expect to find
abortive efforts of nature here, as we so constantly find them
elsewhere, not merely in inorganic matter, but even among the processes
of life.</p>
<p>In Professor Proctor&rsquo;s article (&ldquo;Essays on
Astronomy&rdquo;) on the square-shouldered aspect of Saturn,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>he mentions a hitherto unexplained circumstance
of the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere&mdash;the curious fact that the
barometrical pressure of the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere is somewhat
higher between the poles and the equator than immediately over the
latter, as might be supposed to be the case. This is a phenomenon of
mutual repulsion similar to those manifested in the operations above
described. The rotation of the earth on its axis forces the terrestrial
atmosphere, by its centrifugal motion, in undue proportion, around the
equatorial belt, causing the same sort of atmospheric thinning at the
poles which we see in the solar photosphere at its corresponding parts.
At the same time the highly electrified atmosphere, by its mutually
repellent action, tends to force this swollen equatorial ring backward
toward the poles. The resultant of these two repulsions is an area of
maximum density part way between the poles and the equator. It is
probable that this self-repellent equatorial swell may play some part
in the sun&rsquo;s atmosphere, in extending, and also in limiting, the
areas of eruptive sun-spots outward from his equator.</p>
<p>While the nebul&aelig; are more distant than many of the discrete
stars revealed to us by the telescope, there is no reason to suppose
that they are more distant than the star-clouds into which are merged
the separate stars of the Milky Way, or the star-clusters seen in other
portions of the sky. We know, in fact, that this is not so, for our
telescopes show brilliant stars in very many cases which are components
of the nebul&aelig; themselves; and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb304" href="#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span>fact that the
nebul&aelig; can be seen as having visible form, and not as mere points
of light, is itself conclusive as to their relative distances. Hence we
need not be surprised to learn that these forming spirals will result
each in the production of a single solar system, and not a galaxy of
suns, as was once supposed. Were such the case it would be impossible
for us to observe the structure of the nebul&aelig; at all, as their
distances would be far too vast. Of the forms of the gaseous
nebul&aelig; Guillemin asks, &ldquo;Is the spiral the original form of
those gaseous matters, the condensation of which may give, or has
given, birth to each individual of this gigantic association?&rdquo;
The same author says of these apparently regularly formed nebul&aelig;,
&ldquo;It is impossible not to recognize in them so many
systems.&rdquo; Many of the spiral nebul&aelig; were formerly supposed
to be globular aggregations of nebulous matter only, and their spiral
character came as a great surprise with the use of more powerful
telescopes; and many&mdash;nay, most&mdash;of these apparently globular
nebul&aelig; have totally changed their appearance when viewed with
instruments of higher power, while the spirals have become more and
more pronounced in character with every increase of telescopic vision.
Of one of such apparently globular nebul&aelig; Guillemin says,
&ldquo;The center is like a large globular nebula with a very marked
condensation, whence radiate branches arranged in the form of spirals.
In several points of these branches other centers of condensation are
noticed. Sir John Herschel had classed this among the nebul&aelig; of
rounded, globular form, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href=
"#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span><i>doubtless because the central
nebulosity was the only one revealed by his telescope</i>.&rdquo; The
formation of the sub-centers in this nebula (which is between the Great
Bear and Bo&ouml;tes) should be particularly noted in connection with
the coalescence of planets as above described. In a note to
Guillemin&rsquo;s work, Professor Lockyer says, &ldquo;The proper
motion of nebul&aelig; has not yet been inquired into, because
everybody, looking upon them as irresolvable star-clusters, thought
them infinitely remote. Now, however, that we know they are <i>not</i>
clusters of stars, properly so called, it is possible that they may be
much nearer to us than we imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In connection with the double-sun spiral nebula shown in the
preceding illustration, Guillemin says, &ldquo;We have noticed
nebul&aelig; accompanied by systems of double or multiple stars, placed
in a manner so symmetrical in the midst of the nebulosity that it is
impossible to doubt the existence of a real connection between the
stars and the nebul&aelig;.&rdquo; And Flammarion says of these
apparently globular nebul&aelig;, when under the observation of more
powerful telescopes, &ldquo;In the place where pale and whitish clouds
gave out a calm and uniform light, the giant eye of the telescope has
discerned <i>alternately dark and luminous
regions</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, they reveal the operation of
the opposite forces of attraction and repulsion, and are spiral. While
gaseous nebul&aelig; may be of any conceivable form, the direction and
operation of the forces which will determine their character as solar
systems must be similar, just as with the forms of organic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>life, and the only nebul&aelig; which reveal a
distinct systematic development in harmony with a working solar system
are the spiral. There is no difficulty whatever in tracing such a
nebula through all its formative stages, as we have done, and we can,
in fact, see painted on the background of the sky every step of the
shifting tableau through which such forms must pass.</p>
<p>By the nebular hypothesis the whole course of development, of
necessity, is rigidly forward to its culmination; but by employing the
analogies presented to us in other operations of nature, we can readily
account for variations, haltings, ineffectual efforts, uncompleted
processes, and even reversals and redistributions into other secondary
sources of energy. They equally comprise the agencies for the
production of a single solar system or of a myriad, just as we see the
vortical water-spouts or sand-storms either single, double, or
multiple; they are flexible, as are all the processes of nature, and
require no violent assumption of a prior physical basis known to us
&ldquo;ne&rsquo;er before on sea or shore.&rdquo; They also account for
the deviation from the normal of the orbits of Neptune and Mercury, for
the formation of the asteroids and Saturn&rsquo;s rings, for the
different eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits, for the
forward axial rotation of the planets and their satellites, and even
for their perturbations and abnormalities; they furnish a basis for
Bode&rsquo;s empirical law, for the distribution of the planets in
size, for the origin of comets and meteor streams, for Kepler&rsquo;s
laws, for the equal and permanent relation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>of
eccentricities and inclinations, and for the fixed axial position of
the moon with reference to the earth; they account for the free oxygen
in the planetary and free hydrogen in the solar atmosphere, they employ
the variation of volume of the sun as a regulator instead of an
independent generator of light and heat, and they are in entire
conformity with the established principles which govern the electrical
generation of active forces, their transmission to the sun, their
transformation into light and heat, and their return to the regions of
space, where they continue to act with potential energy to all
eternity, as they must do if space itself is eternal; and we surely
know that, if anything whatever is eternal, space must be so. This
great ocean&mdash;the home, the domain, the workshop of creative
energy&mdash;is the last retreat of the human intellect; here it may
find rest, and here alone. While solar systems may afford in their
circling planets a possible dominion for finite life, and in their suns
their daily bread; in the infinite and all-embracing realms of space,
filled with the potentialities of all created forms, thrilled with the
impulses of all creative force, is to be found the unfailing source of
all, the dominion of the eternal architect, before whom nature bends
the obedient knee, waits to hear his mighty voice, or swiftly runs to
do his royal bidding. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href=

<p class="first">Thus, as we have seen, through countless future ages
will the sun, with his incandescent envelope of hydrogen, and the
planets, with their life-sustaining atmospheres of oxygen, fulfil their
appointed times and courses. But if we could conceive that all
atmospheres, solar and planetary, were suddenly blotted out and forever
annihilated, so that these great orbs thenceforth rolled along as they
do now, but only as black globes in an ocean of space of Stygian
darkness, new atmospheres would at once begin to be formed, and these
would soon again surround the sun and planets, precisely like those
which now exist.</p>
<p>Sweeping along in darkness, the force of gravity would gather around
each of these bodies vast accumulations of aqueous vapor and other
gases condensed from the attenuated matter of surrounding space. The
planets, by their axial rotations, would again generate from these
regions, newly occupied as the system drifted along through space,
electrical energy of enormous quantity and potential. Earth would again
hear the mighty mandate, &ldquo;Let there be light,&rdquo; and from her
poles to her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>equator the skies would blaze with brush-light
auroras. Suddenly, with a mighty leap, the pent-up currents would flash
across to their opposite electric pole, the auroras would gradually die
away, and instantly the molecules of hydrogen would begin to sift out
at the solar and those of oxygen at the planetary terminals. The
electrical currents driving their furious pathway through the rapidly
gathering hydrogen envelope, the sun would first begin to faintly
flicker with hazy, nebulous light; the light would gather intensity,
and soon flash and glow with energy; the solar nucleus within would
become intensely heated and liquefied or partially volatilized, and
again the solar streams of incandescent heat and light would radiate
forth on every side; the commingled gases, oxygen and nitrogen, would
once more surround each planetary globe, and we should have a new solar
envelope just as we now see it, and new planetary atmospheres like our
own; and then, and not till then, would the opposing generative forces
permanently counterbalance each other and electrolytic decomposition
become practically stationary, except to compensate for the slight
variations constantly liable to occur in the complicated running of the
mechanism. So the mutilated crustacean re-grows his lost claws, and so
our own gaping wounds are healed by the great <i>vis medicatrix
natur&aelig;</i>. The most stable of all things is mutually balanced
instability; perhaps there is no other form of stability.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Nebular Hypothesis&rdquo; of Laplace concerns
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>itself only with the aggregate matter of which
our solar system is composed, and the force of gravity, including
cohesion, ignoring the action of the equally powerful force of
repulsion. But there is another nebular hypothesis much older than that
of Laplace and far more scientific, for it utilizes both the force of
gravity and cohesion and the radiant force of repulsion in the
generation of our solar system. We refer to what is known as the Mosaic
cosmogony. Whatever the origin of this magnificent narrative may have
been, whether written down by Moses originally, or by him derived from
the sacred learning of Egypt, with which he was fully acquainted, or by
the Egyptian scribes drawn from Ethiopia, and still further back from
the sacred traditions of India, it bears internal evidence, when
properly rendered from the Hebrew record, of a knowledge of these
stupendous phenomena (which no human eye could ever have beheld) which
is most remarkable. The commonly accepted versions do not clearly bring
out the full meaning of the original,&mdash;indeed, it would have been
impossible for the earlier translators to have done so,&mdash;but when
critically and etymologically rendered, very surprising coincidences
with the succession of events as they must actually have occurred, and
the principles involved in the successive stages of creation, will be
found in nearly every part of the record.</p>
<p>This record is embodied in the first chapter and first three verses
of the second chapter of Genesis. The Hebrew was long believed to be an
original, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>if not an inspired, language, but it is now well
known to have been a derivative or root language, made up much like the
English, and, like it, having the meanings of its words primarily
determined by those of the root-stems from which they have been formed.
The roots of these Hebrew words are to be found among the languages of
many older peoples, and nearly all of them have now been traced to
their immediate origin. Another source of error is in the so-called
Masoretic pointing, which was not introduced for a thousand years after
the time of Moses, and which has often changed the signification of the
older words, and even the form of the words themselves; but by critical
researches the roots and their combinations have been isolated, so that
we are now able to possess a much mere accurate knowledge of the Mosaic
record than was possible in former times, for, of course, no original
copies have come down to us. It is not a reconstruction of the record
which has been made, but a careful editing by means of the derivation
and true signification of the words used, and by careful comparison
among the most ancient versions accessible to modern research. The
English version, while imperfect in its rendering of this ancient
narrative, is not to be considered by any means a false translation,
but it largely errs in failing to give the full radical meaning of the
words employed in the original.</p>
<p>As an illustration of this indefiniteness of rendering in the
ordinary English version let us consider the opening sentences of the
narrative: &ldquo;In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312"
name="pb312">312</a>]</span>the beginning God created the heaven and
the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
upon the face of the deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; of what? Does it mean the beginning
of our own solar system? or of all systems? or of all space? or of
Jehovah (for He has not yet been mentioned or described)? or of the
Aleim themselves,&mdash;that is, did the work begin as soon as the
forces began? and did the latter originate spontaneously, or otherwise?
What &ldquo;God&rdquo; is meant? Is it Jehovah, or Aleim, or some other
God not yet mentioned or described? If we will take every name in the
Bible which is translated God (and it may be any of these according to
the English rendering), we will have legion. We shall even find that
the same word which is translated &ldquo;God&rdquo; was applied by
Jehovah on one occasion to Moses. &ldquo;Created&rdquo;? What is meant
by this word? Was the creating a creation out of nothing? out of
something pre-existing? or something coexisting elsewhere? Was the
creation a direct or an indirect one? by the use of the forces of
nature, or by overriding the forces of nature? Was it a physical
creation by an inconceivable action of mere thought, or will? and if
so, was this thought, or will, God himself, or one of his attributes or
powers only? &ldquo;The heaven&rdquo;? What heaven? Was it that to
which the virtuous are supposed to go after death? or was it some more
physical heaven? Was <i>the</i> heaven the atmospheric heaven, the
interplanetary heaven, the heaven of interstellar space, or that more
extended heaven which lies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href=
"#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>beyond our knowledge? Was
<i>the</i> heaven one of these which He created, or did He create all
the different heavens of all the solar systems and nebul&aelig; at the
same time? &ldquo;Without form&rdquo;? Was the earth without any form
at all? or merely without its present form? or without some particular
form not mentioned? If the earth was a physical structure it must have
had <i>some</i> form; what was it? &ldquo;And void&rdquo;? Was the
earth void like a soap-bubble? or void like a ray of light? or a
vacuum? If it was empty, what was it that was empty? How could the
heaven and earth be void after they had been brought into existence?
&ldquo;Darkness was upon the face of the deep&rdquo;? What deep? Was it
the sea not yet created? or the earth, which is anything but a
&ldquo;deep&rdquo;? was it the atmosphere? or all space? If the latter,
did all other systems of space wait for their light on ours? or did we
wait on theirs? are there no new systems now forming, and none to be
formed hereafter? If all space is meant, where was its outside, or its
face? and what occupied the intervening regions? was it a physical face
or the face of a vacuum? Were these statements to be accepted by faith
or reason? If the former, was it a faith which could only have come
from the experience of after-ages? or was it based on the <i>ipse
dixit</i> of Moses? What was the basis of faith when the record was
first written? was it from generally accepted tradition or by
revelation? Is the record anonymous or does it reveal the name of its
author? If to be endorsed by knowledge and reason, why should not the
narrative be strictly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href=
"#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span>and accurately translated, even at
the expense of conciseness and elegance of diction, in order that the
exact force of every word shall be fully felt and recognized? If the
record is from divine revelation, it is still more essential to know
precisely what was revealed; otherwise we are no better than idolaters;
we are worse, in fact, for we have changed and falsified the landmarks
of religion, and bear false witness against God Himself. We must not
interpret Genesis by records made long subsequently; it must speak for
itself or not at all.</p>
<p>When construed in accordance with the exact definition of the words
themselves quite a new and strange light is thrown upon the history of
the events thus recorded. The great importance of a strict construction
of the translation and fidelity to the original is emphasized by the
fact that the same word was never used in this record to express a
different sense in different parts, nor were two different words ever
used in different places to express the same meaning. It is, therefore,
necessary to give every word of the original its exact fulness and
force. The basis of the following critical translation is to be found
in &ldquo;Mankind: their Origin and Destiny&rdquo; (Longmans &amp; Co.,
London, 1872), but a careful comparison has been made with other
accepted authorities, and the root-meanings of the separate words have
been carefully traced out, so that many necessary changes will be found
to have been made in order to bring out the precise sense of the
original. There is no actual literal, critical, etymological, and
scientific <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>rendering embraced in a single translation known
to us, and which is complete in itself; but that which follows will be
found, it is believed, to give every word its particular etymological
shade of meaning, and to employ the same word in the same place, for
the same purpose, and with the same signification as it was understood
to have, in its original form, when first recorded. The specific
root-meanings of the most important words used are further explained in
detail in a separate section below.</p>
<p>The use of <span class="sc">Aleim</span>, &ldquo;the powerful
Forces,&rdquo; in the plural, followed by the verb in the singular, is
a Hebraism, and indicates the collective character of the forces as
specially energized, sent forth, and directed by Jeove (Jeova or
Jehovah is the Chaldaic form of the word, the original Hebrew being
Jeove), who does not appear by name in this narrative, though, as we
shall see, specially delegated power from some higher source is that
characteristic which is most emphasized throughout the record. These
forces are personified, as is usual in ancient records (and, indeed, in
modern thought), but they are in reality the &ldquo;powers of
God.&rdquo; The author of the work above referred to says, &ldquo;The
idea of Moses was that there was a Supreme God &hellip; and that He
only acts by means of his agents called <span class="sc">Aleim</span>,
the Gods, in the plural and indefinite number, or embassadors, or
voices.&rdquo; The ancient belief in the unity of all forces in one
creative individuality is also most clearly shown in some of the oldest
Vedaic hymns <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316" name=
"pb316">316</a>]</span>of India (see Max M&uuml;ller, &ldquo;The
Veda&rdquo;). &ldquo;Self (Atman) is the Lord of all things, Self is
the King of all things. As all the spokes of a wheel are contained in
the nave and the circumference, all things are contained in this Self;
all selves are contained in this Self. Brahman (Force) itself is but
Self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the religion of the ancient Egyptians (see &ldquo;Evolution and
Christianity,&rdquo; by J. F. York) it is said, &ldquo;The chief
theological characteristic of this first of all known civilized
religions is the doctrine of the Divine Unity. As M. de Roug&eacute;
says, &lsquo;One idea predominates, that of a single and primeval God;
everywhere and always it is one substance, self-existent, and an
unapproachable God.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; The Egyptian cosmogony, as the
fragments have come down to us (see Professor Arnold Guyot,
&ldquo;Creation&rdquo;), is as follows:</p>
<p>1. The <i>original gaseous form, and the darkness of matter</i>.</p>
<p>2. The successive transformations.</p>
<p>3. Light, as the first step in this development.</p>
<p>4. The separation of the waters below from the waters above the
expanse.</p>
<p>5. Periods of development of indefinite length.</p>
<p>6. The sun, moon, and earth organized last.</p>
<p>The word <span class="sc">Mlactou</span>, which occurs several times
repeated in the summing up of this narrative, explains the character of
<span class="sc">Aleim</span> most fully, as specially energized and
directed agencies or forces. This word never has any other meaning.
Even when applied to a king it was not a king as a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>monarch, but as the specially directed agent of
God. <a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"

Exodus xiii. 21</a> it is said that &ldquo;Jeove went before them by
day in a pillar of a cloud,&rdquo; this is explained, in chapter xiv.
verse 19, to mean that this pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night
was Mlac, a messenger, or agent. It is translated &ldquo;angel&rdquo;
in the English version, but it was not a personal angel; it was a
specially energized and directed force. In the earliest times it was
not the God of fire, or of force, or of justice which men feared, but
fire, or force, or justice; the anthropomorphic conception came later
with the generalization of all fire, all force, or all justice. We say
now that a malefactor fears the law; what he really fears, however, is
punishment. In this record we are dealing with the primordial forces of
God,&mdash;gravity, electricity, attraction, repulsion, cohesion, vital
force, etc., etc., but acting with special energy for a predetermined
result. Of these forces Dr. McCosh says, in his work on Christianity
and Positivism, &ldquo;One God, with his infinitely varied
perfections,&mdash;his power, his knowledge, his wisdom, his love, his
mercy; we should see that one Power blowing in the breeze, smiling in
the sunshine, sparkling in the stars, quickening us as we bound along
in the felt enjoyment of health, efflorescing in every form and hue of
beauty, and showering down daily gifts upon us. The profoundest minds
in our day, and in every day, have been fond of regarding <i>this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>force</i>, not as something independent of God,
but as the <i>very power of God acting in all action</i>; so that in
him we live, and move, and have our being.&rdquo; In more rugged and
virile form this was precisely the old Mosaic philosophy, the
philosophy of the arcana of the Egyptian temples, and of the Vedaic age
of the Aryans of India. Where was the radiant center of this unfailing
search-light which has poured its broad belt of dazzling brightness
down to our day from those old, prehistoric ages?</p>
<p>So De Jouvencel, in his &ldquo;Genesis according to Science,&rdquo;
says, &ldquo;We should not place the works of nature on one side and
nature on the other. Nature is a work and not a person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word which in the English version is translated
&ldquo;rested,&rdquo; in the concluding verses of the narrative, does
not mean <i>rested from fatigue</i>, but rested as a pendulum rests
when it ceases to vibrate. Had the word been rendered &ldquo;came to a
state of rest,&rdquo; it would have been far more accurate and true to
the sense of the original. What is meant is that these pent-up forces
had operated, under the guidance of Jeove, to rupture a state of
unstable equilibrium in the attenuated matter of space, just as similar
forces are now said to gather energy to produce a volcanic eruption of
the earth&rsquo;s crust, preceded by earthquakes and other vast
disturbances radiating from the center of rupture of these tensions
between the molecules of matter, accompanied by explosive expansion and
all the phenomena of disorganization and repulsion, and succeeded by
condensation, development, harmony, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>and final quiescence
of these specially energized and self-opposing forces in a newly formed
state of molecular equilibrium. To quote from Professor Guyot,
&ldquo;God rests as the creator of the visible universe. <i>The forces
of nature are now in that admirable equilibrium</i> which we now
behold, and which is necessary to our existence.&rdquo; In &ldquo;The
Unity of Nature&rdquo; the Duke of Argyle says, &ldquo;We strain our
imaginations to conceive the processes of Creation, whilst in reality
they are around us daily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words which conclude the third verse of chapter ii. are also
imperfectly rendered in our English version, and this defect has led to
a popular misconception almost universal. They are construed to mean
&ldquo;created&mdash;and made,&rdquo; as though marking a broad class
distinction between the <span class="corr" id="xd26e2465" title=
"Source: dif-ent">different</span> processes before described. From
this the inference has been drawn that while, for the more subordinate
features, the word rendered &ldquo;made&rdquo; indicated that these
were stages in the process of creation merely involving the use of
coexisting materials, in the grander features of the work it was
supposed that there had been a creation <i>ab initio</i>,&mdash;that
is, <i>out of nothing</i>. Whole libraries have been written on this
theme; but the words used bear no such meaning; on the contrary, they
signify the exact opposite. There is, however, a broad distinction
between the interpretation of the two words; but it is that the word
which is to be rendered &ldquo;fashioned like the work of a
sculptor&rdquo; is narrower and not broader in significance than the
simple word &ldquo;made;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320"
href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>so that the former is
included in, but is not generically distinct from, the latter. The word
<span class="sc">Bra</span> means that these portions of creation were
fashioned with the care and artistic skill of a sculptor, as
contradistinguished from turning out the productions in mass; this
distinction does not relate to the origin, but to the workmanship.
However interstellar or primordial space was formed, or when, if it
ever was formed, there is nothing in this record which excludes a
pre-existent space substantially like that which now is. What we see in
the sky, among the nebul&aelig;, are later developments of like solar
systems, in like manner, from the midst of the substance of the same
illimitable and eternal space.</p>
<p>But biology has an interest in this account of creation equally as
great as has cosmology. The word <span class="sc">Bra</span> is first
applied to the formation of the individualized substance of the heavens
and the earth. They were fashioned or carved out like a sculpture from
something on which the forces could operate. There was, of course,
<i>creation</i> involved, but it was a mental, not a physical process.
When a sculptor has completed his clay figure he has brought forth a
<i>great creation</i>, perhaps, and the &ldquo;creation&rdquo; is still
his own, though the figure be cast in bronze by hired workmen in the
foundry, who execute the sculptor&rsquo;s will at two dollars a day, it
may be, each. Beyond this mental element there is no more
<i>creation</i>, in its widest sense, than when a boy
&ldquo;creates&rdquo; a new point on his pencil by guiding his hand and
knife to sharpen it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321"
name="pb321">321</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the &ldquo;diffused light&rdquo; came, it is not said that it
was &ldquo;fashioned like the work of a sculptor,&rdquo; or that it was
even &ldquo;made;&rdquo; but that it &ldquo;came into existence.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Let there be light, and there was light,&rdquo; as the English
version has it. But when the radiant energy of the sun came to be
formed, on the fourth day, it did not &ldquo;come into
existence,&rdquo; nor was it &ldquo;fashioned like the work of a
sculptor;&rdquo; it was &ldquo;made.&rdquo; The reason is that it was
not a development from the preceding &ldquo;diffused light,&rdquo; but
a new kind of light, made mechanically by the electrolysis of aqueous
vapor around the sun&rsquo;s body, forming a hydrogen envelope, and by
driving the furious torrents of electricity from the planets through
this atmosphere, while the auroral, &ldquo;diffused light&rdquo; of the
earth was gradually dying away during the process. Hence there was no
room for the word <span class="sc">Bra</span>, or for the word
<span class="sc">Iei</span> (came into existence) here; the word to be
used was <span class="sc">Osh</span>. And when life was first
introduced,&mdash;vegetable life, the primal life,&mdash;the word used
is not <span class="sc">Bra</span>; this life was not
&ldquo;fashioned&rdquo; or developed from other life. But when animal
life was afterwards introduced, the word used is <span class=
"sc">Bra</span>; it was a refashioning. What was this life fashioned
out of? It was not &ldquo;made;&rdquo; it did not &ldquo;begin to
exist;&rdquo; it was developed. In this manner the earth was finally
filled with animal life. Then came the introduction of the human race.
Here we again have the word <span class="sc">Bra</span>, thrice
repeated; but when this introduction of mankind was first projected,
and before it was executed, it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322"
href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>was in these words, &ldquo;We
will <i>make</i> [the root <span class="sc">Osh</span>] mankind;&rdquo;
or, in the English version, &ldquo;Let us <i>make</i> man.&rdquo; There
seems here to have been a gradual ascent of living organisms by
development, almost precisely in accordance with the most recent
teachings of science. Two essentially different <i>kinds</i> of light
were successively produced, independently of each other; the earlier
kind &ldquo;came into being,&rdquo; and the later &ldquo;was
made.&rdquo; The substance or entity of the heavens and of the earth,
generically, &ldquo;was fashioned.&rdquo; Three successive
introductions of organic life not essentially different from each other
occurred; the first is described thus: &ldquo;Let the earth bring
forth; &hellip; and the earth brought forth,&rdquo; in the English
version; or &ldquo;There shall be made to grow; &hellip; and there was
caused to arise suddenly out of the ground &hellip; vegetation,&rdquo;
as more accurately rendered. The second form of organic life, in order
of time, the animal, was &ldquo;fashioned.&rdquo; The third form,
mankind, was also &ldquo;fashioned,&rdquo; and this was done long
subsequently to the introduction of the second.</p>
<p>If the word <span class="sc">Bra</span> had any signification of
<i>original creation</i> it would have been applied to the first
creation of life, for it was far more wonderful and original that there
should be vegetable life which grew and developed, which brought forth
flowers and then fruit, which formed germinative seeds, and from these
successively and continuously reproduced its multifarious species, than
that <i>animal</i> life should have been introduced long afterwards
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>to repeat these same things which vegetation had
been, in all its forms, from the lowest to the highest, already doing
for untold ages,&mdash;from the third period of the earth&rsquo;s long
history to the fifth; and more especially still when we consider that
vegetable life and animal life, in their lowest forms, have no positive
line of division between them.</p>
<p>And if <span class="sc">Osh</span>, which is applied to the genesis
of solar light, be capable of the signification of <i>original
creation</i>, then this word should have been applied to the generation
of the &ldquo;diffused light&rdquo; of the second day, for the genesis
of light is far more wonderful and original than the subsequent
production of sunlight, after the forming earth had existed for two
whole formative periods, from the second to the fourth, under the
constant illumination of this universally diffused auroral light. If,
on the other hand, the words applied to the first generation of light
and the first generation of life be held to mark an <i>original
creation</i>, then these words are never applied in this whole
narrative to the genesis of the <i>entity</i> of the heavens, or the
earth, or the sun and moon, or to animal life, or the life of man.</p>
<p>The radiant light and heat of the sun were not made until the fourth
day, while the introduction of vegetable life dates from the long
antecedent third day of creation. Prior to the development of the
sun&rsquo;s thermal light there could have been, as we have already
shown, no free oxygen in the terrestrial atmosphere; and it is a
remarkable circumstance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href=
"#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>that vegetation, which is the only
form of organic life which could have existed and propagated its
species in an atmosphere composed of carbonic, nitrogenous, and aqueous
vapors, devoid of oxygen, is that particular form of life which has
been selected for this purpose, and its advent placed prior to the
making of the sun. It would have been far more reasonable (previous to
our present knowledge of these things) to have placed the formation of
the sun in advance of the introduction of life; it is surprising that
this was not done, unless we give to these &ldquo;ancients&rdquo; a
knowledge of the principles of natural science far beyond anything
hitherto attributed to them.</p>
<p>In the same connection there is described a stage preparatory to and
leading up to the simultaneous development of the sun&rsquo;s light and
heat, and the sifting out of hydrogen around the solar core, and of
oxygen in the terrestrial atmosphere, which is equally remarkable. The
&ldquo;separation of the waters&rdquo; described in verses 6 and 7 has
never been fully rendered into English, or even understood in the
original, as the words seemed meaningless in their literal sense until
correctly interpreted by the facts set forth in the present work.</p>
<p>We must first note that the separation of the waters of space to two
opposite foci, with an intervening space of attenuated matter, and
their condensation there into two entirely different bodies, was the
work of the second day, while the formation of the terrestrial
rain-clouds and seas, as connected together, was a work of the third
day, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>was not accomplished until then, which was long
afterwards. These entirely different operations&mdash;different in
time, place, character, and circumstance&mdash;have always been
confounded with each other; but one is in reality systemic and the
other merely local.</p>
<p>In verse 6 there was decreed an expanse or <i>thinning</i> (an
attenuated region) in the <i>center</i> of the waters, and a separation
was made by the formation of two &ldquo;spots&rdquo; (verse 7), one
under the expanse and the other above the expanse; the expanse was
space, interplanetary space. Professor Arnold Guyot, in his book on
Creation, says, &ldquo;It is to be regretted that the English version
has translated the Hebrew word <i>expanse</i> by the word
<i>firmament</i>&hellip;. The difficulties they [the commentators] have
created for themselves arose &hellip; from depriving it of its
cosmogonic character and belittling it by reducing the great phenomena
there described to a simple modification of the terrestrial
atmosphere&#8202;&hellip;. They forget that this thin covering of
clouds is but a temporary and ever-changing one, and that the clouds
are <i>in</i> that heaven rather than above it&#8202;&hellip;. They
forget that this is not the true heavens in which are spread the sun
and moon and stars&#8202;&hellip;. This grand day, so dwarfed and
misunderstood, is the one in which are described the generations of the
heavens, announced by Moses, which otherwise find no place in the
narrative of the creative week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two foci of waters were the solar and terrestrial; around these
bodies were gathered by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href=
"#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>attraction of gravity, and there
condensed, the aqueous vapors from the attenuated intervening matter of
space; the earth by its rotation generated the enormous electrical
currents which still continue; when these made their mighty leap across
to the sun, the diffused auroral light around the earth gradually
disappeared, hydrogen and oxygen began to be evolved at the opposite
poles&mdash;the sun and the earth&mdash;from the condensed envelopes of
aqueous vapor which surrounded them, the sun&rsquo;s hydrogen
atmosphere was pierced, as in the pail-of-water experiment described in
an earlier chapter of the present work, by the planetary electric
currents, the sun became incandescent, and <i>pari passu</i> the earth
became fitted, by the development of oxygen, for the abode of animal
life. As taking part in this great mechanical transformation, the sun
was said to have been &ldquo;made;&rdquo; it did not &ldquo;come into
being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just prior to the introduction of vegetable life&mdash;during the
same creative epoch, in fact, and for the support of which life it was
necessary&mdash;the waters under the expanse were condensed into
rain-clouds and seas, and there is a curious reference (verse 9) to the
appearance of the earth&rsquo;s dryness &ldquo;as produced by the
action of an internal fire;&rdquo; the gradual cooling of the earth by
the radiation of its internal heat of condensation into space would
account for this appearance, and, in connection with the diffused
auroral light throughout the whole sky, would doubtless have sufficed
for the support of vegetable life. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327"
href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p>In verse 16 the fixed stars (the suns of other systems) are referred
to, but in a parenthetical statement&mdash;almost deprecatory, in
fact&mdash;that &ldquo;the dim and almost extinct lights&rdquo; the
same forces created also, but when they were created is not stated in
the record. The occasion for this incidental remark is to be found in
the preceding statement that the two new luminaries, the sun and moon,
were the two &ldquo;superior bodies in size of the starry
lights.&rdquo; Having mentioned the stars in this comparison, the
author feels called upon to add that the latter also had been similarly
created,&mdash;that is, that they were not original existences, and of
course they are not, but they were not created at that epoch, and are
not said to have been.</p>
<p>In chapter ii. verse 4, which opens the second narrative (quite a
different history, by the way), Jeove appears Himself, joined with the
Aleim, and henceforth this personal connection is maintained; the
English version translates this composite word &ldquo;The Lord
God,&rdquo; which means the Master God; the correct reading is,
however, the &ldquo;God of gods,&rdquo; or what we call the &ldquo;God
of the forces of nature,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;God
omnipotent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the whole Mosaic cosmogony there is nothing which can even
suggest a gradually closing nebulous mass; the element of rotation is
absent (and it would not have been understood by the people even if
presented); but, with this exception, the processes of development are
substantially in accord with what must really have taken place, and in
the order described. But it is, as before stated, absolutely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>essential to understand the root-meanings of all
the more important words used in the original. A superficial
translation is not only meaningless, but misleading; whereas, when
accurately understood, the record is one of the most remarkable ever
presented to human intelligence. The words used were selected
deliberately for their specific shades of meaning, and, unless these
are properly rendered, to the uninformed the narrative will present a
simple succession of startling phenomena, while to the educated student
each of these changes carries within its verbal index its origin, its
mode, and the knowledge of the forces at work. To the one it is a
dramatic spectacle performed on the stage in front; to the other it is
the same work as seen behind the curtain, with all the intermoving
mechanism (the author&rsquo;s manuscript the sole guide), the interplay
of complicated forces, the triumphant successes, the rapt attention,
and even the sudden applause extorted at each wondrous climax from the
skilled actors themselves, who are at the same time unceasingly engaged
in working out the mighty drama of creation. One might readily believe
that the original author of this record was thoroughly acquainted with
the processes involved in the development of a solar system like our
own from the diffused primordial matter of space, substantially as we
have endeavored, in the present work, to deduce them from the most
recent investigations and discoveries of science.</p>
<p>Of the watery vapors condensed above the expanse of space many of
the ancient writers had a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href=
"#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>far more correct knowledge than
had those who translated these chapters from the original into the
various modern languages. In the Psalms we read, &ldquo;Praise him,
&hellip; ye waters that be above the heavens;&rdquo; in the Song of the
Three Holy Children, &ldquo;O all ye waters that be above the
heavens.&rdquo; Theophilus speaks of the &ldquo;visible sky as having
<i>drawn to itself</i> a portion of the waters of chaos at the time of
the creation.<span class="corr" id="xd26e2610" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> Saint Augustine says that the firmament
has been formed &ldquo;<i>between</i> the upper and the lower
waters,&rdquo; and quotes <a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gn%201:6-7&amp;version=NRSV">
Genesis i. 6 and 7</a>, as his authority.</p>
<p>Thousands of years ago, as far back as the days of the Pythagoreans,
and even long before, mankind was acquainted with the mariner&rsquo;s
compass, telescopic tubes, and glass lenses; they knew that the moon
receives her light by reflection from the sun, of the presence of
mountains and valleys on the lunar surface, that her day and night are
each a fortnight in length, that there were other planets known to the
Egyptians besides the seven known to the Greeks (the Brahmans reckoned
fifteen of them), that the sun is the center of our planetary system,
that the earth and the other planets revolve around it, that the earth
is round and rotates on its own axis daily, that weight is a principal
element in the maintenance of these rotations, that the fixed stars are
suns, and that the Milky Way appears white from the number of stars
which it contains. Kircher quotes from an ancient Syrian author the
philosophy of the sidereal system, dividing it into many layers or
spheres attached to orbits, each presided <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>over by a spirit. In
the eighth sphere are placed the fixed stars, &ldquo;still higher two
other layers of stars not less luminous, and of different sizes, the
nebul&aelig; and the small stars of the Milky Way, and the whole is
surrounded by the celestial waters, which spread over the whole
firmament, and which compose the great sea of light and the boundless
ocean.&rdquo; The sources of all this wondrous knowledge can be traced
back through Chaldea, Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, and, through the colony
of Mero&euml;, to India.</p>

CREATION.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Aleim</span> (&ldquo;corruptly called Elohim by the
modern Jews, but always Aleim in the synagogue copies&rdquo;) means the
Strong Forces (or, by subsequent impersonation, subaltern gods),
operating to carry out the purposes and execute the plans of Jeove.
<span class="sc">Al</span>, the root, signifies <i>Strong</i>,
<i>strength</i>, <i>a ram</i>; <span class="sc">Al-e</span> means

(plural) means the Forces, the Strong-ones, the Powers, and in Egyptian

darkness</i>, while <span class="sc">u-beou</span> refers to <i>life
which is about reappearing</i>, but still hidden in the egg or the
ovary, and waiting for the word which shall cause the dawn of creation
to shine upon it.&rdquo; These words are more properly rendered
&ldquo;tomb-like darkness and undeveloped.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Eshc</span> means <i>darkness</i>; not merely an
intense darkness, but what may be denominated a &ldquo;thick
darkness;&rdquo; it is an <i>enshrouding <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2835" title="Source: darknesss">darkness</span></i> which
<i>compresses</i> and <i>hinders</i>. It is precisely such a darkness
as would be produced by the interstratified cloud-layers between the
convolutions of a forming spiral nebula, or the cloud-strata
surrounding the earth before electrolytic decomposition of the aqueous
vapors had ensued. With the advent of the sun, in the narrative, this
darkness and the term which expresses it disappear.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Teou-m</span> is the word above explained, with the
termination <span class="sc">-m</span>, expressing the idea of
<i>arrested</i>, <i>doubtful</i>, <i>indefinite</i>, as applied to all
existence; the word &ldquo;undifferentiated nature&rdquo; properly
interprets its vagueness and general character of an abyss of being, in
the etymological sense of &ldquo;nature&rdquo; as the totality of
things at that time born or produced.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rove</span> means <i>breath</i>, in the sense of an
expanding, liberating, or developing spirit; its literal meaning is
&ldquo;the breath, the spirit which dilates and frees.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mrepht</span>, <i>brooded with incubating love</i>;
<span class="sc">reph</span> is composed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb332" href="#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>of <span class=
"sc">re</span>, &ldquo;to be full of good-will, to be agreeable,&rdquo;
and <span class="sc">eph</span>, &ldquo;to cover, to protect, to
incubate, to brood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mim</span>, <i>the seeds of all beings</i>, <i>the
waters</i>. It is said, &ldquo;the choice of this letter <span class=
"sc">m</span>, to signify water [the alphabetical Egyptian letter
<span class="sc">m</span> is represented by the two undulatory lines
which in the hieroglyphics represent water], is connected with the
Egyptian ideas of the cause of the generation of living beings.&rdquo;

Numbers xxiv. 7</a>, &ldquo;He shall pour the waters out of his
buckets, and the seed [<span class="sc">zro</span>] in the waters
[<span class="sc">b-mim</span>].&rdquo; The latter word is plural in
form, but both singular and plural in sense.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Aour</span>, <i>diffused light</i>; a light
resembling the dawn, but quite distinct from the light of the sun. The
latter was not established until the fourth day, and its advent is
characterized by a new word, <span class="sc">leair</span>, &ldquo;to
cause light to <i>move</i> above the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Joum</span> is <i>day</i>, generically, and
<span class="sc">lile</span> <i>night</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rqi&ocirc;</span>, <i>the expanse</i>; <span class=
"sc">atrqi&ocirc;</span>, <i>the individualized substance of the
expanse</i>. Space, in the opinion of the Egyptians, &ldquo;not being a
vacuum, but a material substance, Moses could say, and was even
compelled to say, &lsquo;the substance of space, that which constitutes
it.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Osh</span>, made. This word first occurs in verse
7, and is there applied to the <i>making</i> a separation between the
waters or aqueous vapors condensed around the earth and those condensed
around some similar spot &ldquo;above, as regards the individuality of
the expanse,&rdquo;&mdash;to wit, the solar core or nucleus,&mdash;to
which, attracted by gravity from the attenuated vapors of the space
between, is due the subsequent establishment of the solar light and
heat, as in an electrical arc light, and the presence of oxygen in the
terrestrial atmosphere. These processes, involving the constitution of
our atmosphere and of the sun&rsquo;s photosphere and chromosphere,
were not completed until two subsequent cosmical periods had elapsed,
from the third to the fifth. The word <span class="sc">osh</span>, in
its different combinations and inflections, is also used in verse 11,
where it signifies &ldquo;making,&rdquo; as applied to fruit;
&ldquo;yielding&rdquo; fruit, in verse 12; &ldquo;they made,&rdquo; as
applied to the sun and moon, in verse 16; &ldquo;made,&rdquo; as
applied to the entity of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href=
"#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>quadrupeds and higher animals
generally, in verse 25; &ldquo;we will make,&rdquo; as applied to man,
verse 26; &ldquo;had made,&rdquo; as applied to &ldquo;every entity of
creation,&rdquo; verse 31; &ldquo;had made,&rdquo; as applied to the
specially directed work as <span class="sc">mlactou</span>, chapter ii.
verse 2; and finally, in the general summing up in verse 3 of the
second chapter, as an element in a compound substantive phrase
&ldquo;according to the making-act,&rdquo; or &ldquo;in accordance with
the making of creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Oshout</span>,&rdquo; it is said,
&ldquo;signifies a manual operation, carried on according to a
previously conceived idea, or model.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We find a similar use of the substantive infinitive with a preceding
preposition in verse 21, chapter iii. &ldquo;<span class=
"sc">Ctnout</span> is derived from <span class="sc">tne</span>, a
consoling word. <span class="sc">Tnout</span>, the infinitive of the
conjugation Piel, adds to the word the act of causing to be done, and
of doing with care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A similar construction, <span class="sc">lraout</span>, is employed
in chapter ii. verse 19, translated in the English version, &ldquo;and
brought them unto Adam <i>to see</i> what &hellip;&rdquo;; more
literally, &ldquo;as regards the act of seeing,&rdquo; or according to
a vision, or show. That is, they were brought and presented to his
sight.</p>
<p>The object in writing these two words, <span class="sc">bra</span>
and <span class="sc">l-osh-out</span>, together at the very end of the
narrative was to conclusively establish the fact, beyond all possible
doubt, that the whole work of creation was an orderly and harmonious
progression.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mlactou</span>, which word is used twice in verse 2
and once in verse 3 of the second chapter, and not previously, is also
introduced for specific emphasis. It means that the whole preceding
work of creation was, in its nature, &ldquo;the work of Mlac,&rdquo; a
messenger, or a specially energized and directed agency, sent to fulfil
the appointed work of Jeove. Its purpose was to forever prevent the
belief that the work of creation was due to mere natural forces, on the
one hand, operating by chance; and, on the other, that these forces
were independent gods carrying out their own purposes, and of their own
will. It was set up as a double barrier against rationalism on the one
side and polytheism on the other.</p>
<p>It may be incidentally added that the popular belief that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>&ldquo;Adam was created out of the dust of the
earth&rdquo; is not in accordance with the original record. In the
second narrative, chapter ii. verse 7, the word <span class=
"sc">ophr</span> is rendered &ldquo;dust&rdquo; in our English version,
but it does not signify ordinary terrestrial dust at all; &ldquo;its
radical meaning is to volatilize a substance, to sublimate it.&rdquo;
The true signification of the word used is analogous to a
&ldquo;material essence.&rdquo; The same word is used in <a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nm%2023:10&amp;version=NRSV">
Numbers xxiii. 10</a> as a synonym for &ldquo;seed;&rdquo; it is said
that &ldquo;the Septuagint version translates <span class=
"sc">ophr</span> by <i>sperma</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The formation, described in the third chapter, of the female human
being out of one of the ribs of Adam, excised for that purpose (which
is a matter of almost universal popular belief), is not, in reality,
what is stated in the original. In verse 21 of chapter ii. the words
are rendered in our version, &ldquo;And he took one of his ribs.&rdquo;
What is really said, however, is &ldquo;And he brought out another one
from his sides.&rdquo; So the similar expression in verse 22 in reality
signifies, &ldquo;caused to be made according to womankind the
individualized substance of his side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word translated &ldquo;<i>of his ribs</i>&rdquo; is precisely
the same as is subsequently used by the same writer (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2037:27&amp;version=NRSV">Exodus
xxxvii. 27</a>) to designate the location of the supporting rings upon
an altar of incense, and is there rendered, &ldquo;by the two corners
of it, upon the two sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The defective translation is due to imperfect knowledge, at that
time, of the processes of organic development. The true signification
is that given in the &ldquo;Institutes of Manu&rdquo;: &ldquo;Having
divided his own sub-sistence, the Mighty Power became half male and
half female.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words rendered &ldquo;help meet&rdquo; in verses 18 and 20 have
a far higher meaning; &ldquo;I will make him a help meet&rdquo; should
be translated, &ldquo;I will cause to be made for him an overseeing
help as a guide, an instructor, a revealer.&rdquo; And in verse 20 of
chapter iii., &ldquo;And Adam called his wife&rsquo;s name Eve,&rdquo;
the latter word is not translated; the correct rendering is, &ldquo;And
Adam called the symbolic name of his wife the female serpent-wise
revealer, she who explains, points out things, who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>instructs,&rdquo; for that is what the true
root-meaning of Eve signifies. The concluding words of this verse,
&ldquo;because she was the mother of all living,&rdquo; are obviously
mistranslated, for not only was she not a mother at all, but she did
not even conceive, as stated in the next chapter, until she had left
the garden finally. The true signification is, &ldquo;because she was
the mother of all [spiritual, see verse 22, as contradistinguished from
animal and vegetable] life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The female human being, the word translated woman, has the generic
root-signification of &ldquo;flame,&rdquo; while, prior to Eve, that of
the Adamic man is the &ldquo;red earth.&rdquo; As the male was formed
from a material earthly essence, the female was created one remove
further from the gross and material in the direction of the spiritual;
and her powers were distinctively subjective, those of intuition, while
those of the male were objective, those derived from instruction. Even
in the final curse (so called) the man turns back to the earth to earn
his subsistence, while the woman turns forward to the instruction of
the future men and women, the children; for the words, &ldquo;In sorrow
shalt thou bring forth children,&rdquo; have left one word of the
original untranslated, and by supplying this the sense is entirely
changed, &ldquo;and conceiving, and bringing forth, in sorrow shalt
thou bring up, care for, and train children.&rdquo; In those countries
childbirth was never attended with much pain or sorrow.</p>
<p>The obvious effect of the whole inspired or traditionary second
narrative is to clearly differentiate the contrasted faculties of the
two sexes, and the root-meanings of the words employed, whether Moses
himself perceived it or not, are a testimonial of the highest possible
character for woman, instead of being, as rendered in the ordinary
versions, a mark of inferiority, or even of degradation. In the garden
scene, when she partook of the fruit of the tree of knowledge, she did
not do it hastily or from mere temptation; it is said that &ldquo;she
considered it attentively;&rdquo; the same word being used as was
employed in the first narrative to mark the intense interest and almost
superhuman character of the consideration by the Aleim of the work, as
its successive stages <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href=
"#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>appeared, which they were
delegated to perform, and which Jeove himself directed. The prize, to
her, far outweighed the penalty, and the aspiring sibyl dared to lift
the innermost veil in the adytum of the temple, and grasp the lofty
truths which made her as one of the Aleim. So fell Prometheus.</p>
<p>And then, no sooner had the flame-crowned seer won her precious
prize, than, woman-like, she turned and laid it before her husband, and
he, the innocent one, &ldquo;did eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serpent was not a mere snake, be it understood; it was the
Egyptian Typhon, the dark Spirit of doubt, the questioner, the tempter,
the eternal <span class="sc">if</span>, the why, whence, what, and
whither?</p>
<p>It was her insatiable aspiration to reach the highest possible
limits of human knowledge which gave strength to her daring, and not a
childish fancy for an apple. All this, of course, is lost in the
translation. It is as though the national standard of a mighty people
had been disinterred from the remains of past ages, which had been
borne aloft at the head of mighty armies for centuries, and for which
thousands had gloriously died in battle in defence of a sacred cause,
and which now, its past history untraced, has been catalogued as a
brass bird of some sort mounted on a stick.</p>
<p>It is to be regretted that there is no plain, popular work by a
thoroughly capable scholar, without theological or anti-theological
bias, which treats of the origin, form, root-derivation, usage,
accurate signification, and construction of the comparatively few words
employed in the ancient narratives which compose the first half-dozen
chapters of Genesis, and, we may add, the book of Job; something like
those inestimable works which deal with the ancient cosmogonic
literature of Egypt, Babylonia, Persia, India, China, Ph&oelig;nicia,
and Central America. Nothing of this sort is to be found, at all events
in a form accessible to the general reader, and such a work, in small
compass, would be of the highest importance to popular instructors, to
students, and to the public as well, for it would throw a flood of
light on these extremely valuable but, hitherto, so illy-comprehended
records. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=

<p class="first">THE MOSAIC NARRATIVE OF CREATION.</p>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Aleim</span>, the Forces, fashioned like the
work of a sculptor, in the commencement of individualized existence,
the individualized substance of the heavens and the individualized
substance of the earth.</p>
<p>2. And the earth was in tomb-like darkness and undeveloped, and
there was compressive hindering darkness on the surface of
undifferentiated nature. And the dilating and liberating Spirit of the
Forces hovered with incubating love on the surface of the seeds of all
beings, the waters.</p>
<p>3. Then Aleim said, There shall be a diffused light; and a diffused
light was.</p>
<p>4. And Aleim regarded with attention the individualized substance of
the diffused light, because good. And Aleim caused a separation to be
made between the diffused light and between the compressive hindering
darkness.</p>
<p>5. Then Aleim exclaimed for the diffused light, <span class=
"sc">Day!</span> and for the compressive hindering darkness exclaimed,
<span class="sc">Night!</span> And there was a transition from light to
darkness, and then there was a renewal of light; <span class="sc">First
Day</span>.</p>
<p>6. Then Aleim said, There shall be an expansion obtained by a
thinning in the center of the waters, and there was that which caused a
separation to be made by occupying a spot, the waters according to the
waters.</p>
<p>7. And Aleim made the individualized substance of the expanse, and
caused a separation to exist by the occupation of the spot, of the
waters which are under as regards the expanse of space, and by the
occupation of the spot, of the waters which are above as regards the
expanse of space; and it was so.</p>
<p>8. Then Aleim exclaimed for the expanse of space, <span class=
"sc">The Heavens!</span> and there was a transition from light to
darkness, and then there was a renewal of light; <span class=
"sc">Second Day</span>.</p>
<p>9. And Aleim said, The waters which are underneath the heavens will
tend directly, in order to meet in it, towards a single spot fixed upon
for their meeting; and of dryness produced by the action of an internal
fire the appearance shall be made; and it was so. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span></p>
<p>10. Then Aleim exclaimed for the dryness, <span class=
"sc">Earth!</span> and for the spot fixed upon for the meeting of the
waters exclaimed, <span class="sc">Seas!</span> Then Aleim looked
attentively at it, because good.</p>
<p>11. And Aleim said, There shall be made to grow from the earth a
dwarf vegetation which can be trodden under foot, a maturing plant
causing to be sowed around it a seed, the strong and woody substance of
fruit making fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself above the
earth; and it was so.</p>
<p>12. And there was caused to arise suddenly and full of strength a
dwarf vegetation, a maturing plant sowing around it seed after his
kind; and the woody substance yielding fruit whose seed is in itself
after his kind. Then Aleim considered it, because good.</p>
<p>13. And there was a transition from light to darkness, and then
there was a renewal of light; <span class="sc">Third Day</span>.</p>
<p>14. Then Aleim said, There shall be starry-lights in the expanse of
space of the heavens to separate between the duration of the day and
between the duration of the night; and they shall be for signs, and for
seasons, and for the days which make the year, and for the repetitions
of years.</p>
<p>15. And they shall be for luminous bodies in the expanse of space of
the heavens to cause light to move above the earth; and it was so.</p>
<p>16. And Aleim made a double individualized substance, the superior
in size and excellence of the starry-lights, the individualized
substance which was the greater of the luminous bodies to represent the
rule of the day, and the lesser luminous body to represent the rule of
the night.</p>
<p>Of the dim and almost extinct lights [the stars] they made the
individualized substance also.</p>
<p>17. And Aleim established these individualized substances in the
expanse of space of the heavens to make light move above the earth.</p>
<p>18. And to be representatives of dominion during the day and during
the night, and to separate between the continuance of diffused light
and between the continuance of compressive <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>hindering darkness; then Aleim looked
attentively at it, because good.</p>
<p>19. And there was a transition from light to darkness, and then
there was a renewal of light; <span class="sc">Fourth Day</span>.</p>
<p>20. Then Aleim said, The waters shall bring forth a swarm of
swarming creatures having living breath; and that which flies, the
birds, shall be made to fly with strength and fleetness above the earth
in the space extended of the heavens.</p>
<p>21. And Aleim fashioned like the work of a sculptor the
individualized substance of those which are superior in size of the
gigantic reptiles and every individualized substance having living
breath, that moveth, which they had produced, swarming from the waters,
according to their kind; and every individualized substance of flying
thing with wings, after his kind. Then Aleim looked attentively at it,
because good.</p>
<p>22. And Aleim blessed these individualities by saying, propagate
your species and multiply yourselves, and fill the individualized
substance of the waters in the seas; and as for the flying thing, it
shall multiply itself on the earth.</p>
<p>23. And there was a transition from light to darkness, and then
there was a renewal of light; <span class="sc">Fifth Day</span>.</p>
<p>24. Then Aleim said, From the earth shall be brought forth the
living breath according to its kind, the quadruped, and the being which
moveth about, and the terrestrial animal according to its kind; and it
was so.</p>
<p>25. And Aleim made the individualized substance of the animal of the
earth according to his kind, and the individualized substance of the
quadruped according to his kind, and every individualized substance
that moveth about of red earth according to his kind. Then Aleim
regarded it, because good.</p>
<p>26. Then Aleim said, We will make mankind of a like order of
intellect with ourselves, and they shall extend their dominion over the
fish of the sea, and over the bird of the heavens, and over the
quadruped, and over all of the earth, and over all the moving beings
that move about over the earth.</p>
<p>27. And Aleim fashioned like the work of a sculptor the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>individualized substance of mankind in the
exactness of a shadow cast upon a wall; on this shadow Aleim carved the
individuality; male and female they fashioned the individualized
substance.</p>
<p>28. Then Aleim blessed the individualized substance. And Aleim said
unto them, Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the individualized
substance of the earth, and subdue it, and extend your dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over all
life of the being which moveth about over the earth.</p>
<p>29. And Aleim said, Behold I have given for you every useful
plant-substance yielding seed, yielding seed which there is over the
surface of all the earth, and every individualized substance of tree
which has in it fruit pertaining to a tree yielding seed, yielding seed
for you, it shall be for food.</p>
<p>30. And for all animal life of the earth, and for everything that
flies in the heavens, and for every being that moveth over the surface
of the earth which has in it living breath, every individualized
substance which is a green maturing plant shall be for food. And it was
so.</p>
<p>31. Then Aleim looked at every individualized substance which they
had made, and behold it was as good as possible. And there was a
transition from light to darkness, and then there was a renewal of
light; <span class="sc">Sixth Day</span>.</p>
<p>(Chapter ii.) 1. Then the finishing was made of the heavens, and of
the earth, and of all the orderly arrangement.</p>
<p>2. And Aleim [the Forces] finished on the seventh day the divinely
appointed and directed work which they had performed; and they came
again to a state of rest on the seventh day from all the appointed work
which they had done.</p>
<p>3. Then Aleim blessed the individualized substance of the seventh
day and sanctified it, because in it they returned to their primitive
condition from all the divinely appointed and directed work which the
Forces had fashioned like the work of a sculptor, in accordance with
the making of creation.</p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">CONCLUSION. THE HARMONY OF NATURE&rsquo;S LAWS AND
OPERATIONS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have passed before us the different orders of
celestial phenomena; we have called down the denizens of the starry
skies and placed them on the witness stand, and we have interrogated
them in the light of the evidence which they have given before; we have
compared their different statements, and have found that in their
testimony they all finally agree. Instead of confusion, we find order;
instead of complexity, simplicity; instead of discord, harmony; and
through all we see the orderly progress of nature with uniform step,
from stage to stage, higher and higher, until at last she stands
triumphant, the handmaid of creative power, in the very center of the
arch of the universe. We have taken the simplest operations which we
find in progress around us, and have extended them to larger
operations, constantly keeping in view their relevancy and the facts
which form their sole support. Mere speculation has been excluded, and
theory has found its every step based on an established fact. In this
way we may hope to make place for further investigation in this field
by abler minds, and that the conclusions of science may then become so
well <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>understood and so firmly established that to go
back to the &ldquo;dead-and-dying&rdquo; theories of solar energies
will be like going back to Ptolemy and Tycho for our astronomy.</p>
<p>We have considered the hypothesis which bases the energy of our sun
upon his inherent heat, upon combustion, upon the accretion of meteoric
streams, and upon his slow and gradual condensation of volume; and have
found that all these hypotheses, singly or combined, fail to account
for his energy through the vistas of the past, during which we know he
must have shone as he now shines, and fail to account for more than a
slow but inevitable decline, in the relatively near future, into
eternal darkness and death. We have found that all these theories are
alike, in that they recognize the sun itself as the only source of his
energy, that his enormous emission of light and heat is almost entirely
wasted in empty space, and that this will go on with the same frightful
waste until he has squandered his whole patrimony and ends his
melancholy career in the poor-house or the dungeon. We have, however,
seen that even this will not save the wretched client, for he has
already spent far more than he ever could have received originally by
inheritance, and far more than he could have gained by gifts pitched in
in bulk&mdash;like the poor colored brother&rsquo;s
potatoes&mdash;through the window.</p>
<p>We have therefore gone over the case anew, and have learned that
enormous electrical currents are constantly passing between the earth
and the sun, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>with practically no resistance, and this
irrespective of any hypothesis, actual or possible; and these facts
have solved at the outset one of the greatest conceivable
difficulties,&mdash;to wit, that of the transmission through space of
such essential currents. Turning our attention to the more recent
advances in electricity and the arts of electrical construction, we
have found that induction machines, as contradistinguished from the
older friction machines, operate in a manner strongly suggestive of the
rotation of a planet through space, and we learn that the electrical
potential of the air overhead increases constantly by an enormous
multiplying number as we ascend, proving great electrical action in the
regions immediately surrounding the earth, and which we have called the
terrestrial electrosphere. We have also found that sun-spots and solar
storms and other disturbances are at once reflected in our
earth-currents, and are followed immediately by great electrical
disturbances here and by extensive auroral displays at night.
Experiment shows that similar auroral displays may be produced with an
electrical machine by interruption of the current leading to its
principal condenser, thus demonstrating that the currents are
<i>from</i> the earth to the sun, and not the converse. We have also
found that while the solar atmosphere is largely composed of hydrogen
gas, that of the earth and other planets is largely composed of oxygen,
and that these gases, the constituents of water, are separately
disengaged at the opposite electrical poles by the electrolytic action
of a powerful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>current of electricity applied to the
decomposition of aqueous vapors, in accordance with the established
electrical law that any fluid which will transmit a current may be
decomposed by it; hence we learn that our interplanetary space contains
attenuated aqueous vapors, which we have also learned to be true from
other sources. As our other planets, as well as the earth, are found to
be surrounded with an atmosphere of dilute oxygen, and with aqueous
vapors suspended in it, we know that their action upon the sun must be
similar to that of the earth, and that the congeries of planets thus
unite in their supply of electricity to the sun in constant and
enormous currents. Examining now the effects of passing powerful
electrical currents through a compressed envelope of hydrogen gas
surrounding a conductor, we find that great heat ensues, that the
hydrogen becomes highly incandescent, and that the metallic nucleus
within is raised to an extremely high temperature, and we also observe
the same effects when the current is transmitted through the separated
carbons of an electrical arc light. We have thus accounted for the
constant supply of the energy which, transformed into light and heat,
as in the last-mentioned experiments, the sun pours forth perpetually
into space. We have also learned that electrical induction machines
derive their electrical currents from the surrounding air, and also
that no electricity can be generated in, or transmitted through, a
vacuum, and hence we learn that the planets, by the rotation of their
electrospheres in contact with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345"
href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>the attenuated vapors of
space, generate these powerful electrical currents with which the sun
is supplied, and that the sun merely restores to the ocean from which,
in another form, it was abstracted the light and heat which he emits,
and that, instead of all being wasted except that which falls upon the
planets, in fact that is the only part which actually, in one sense at
least, is wasted: all the rest is deposited in bank, but that is
&ldquo;spent.&rdquo; The important generalization is thus arrived at,
that the true source of solar energy is to be found in the attenuated
vapors of space, and that the mode is that of the generation of
electricity by the rotating planetary electrospheres, its transference
through the aqueous vapors of interplanetary space to the sun, its
passage under resistance through the compressed hydrogen envelope, its
transformation there into light and heat, and its final emission or
backpouring into space again. The molecular motions which give rise to
light and heat in their passage through the vast distances of space are
finally retarded by and disappear as radiated energy in the restoration
or increase of the intermolecular tension of the vapors of space, and
these processes continue, and must continue, to all eternity, if the
sun exists and his planets continue to revolve in orderly circuit
around him. If there be any permanent degradation of energy, it must be
with reference to the total volume of infinite, or at least indefinite,
space, and not with reference to the relatively minute spark of fire
which we call the sun. We have also learned that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>moon&rsquo;s electrosphere is repelled by that
of its neighbor, the earth, and that whatever vapor and atmosphere it
may have can exist only on its opposite side; and we have also learned
that, by reason of the moon&rsquo;s peculiar axial rotation with
reference to the earth, any other arrangement of the lunar moisture and
air, even if such were possible, would have absolutely prohibited all
life on that subordinate planet at any stage of its existence whatever.
We have applied the above principles to the fixed stars, and have
learned that, by the same law, the resplendent star itself is proof
conclusive that it, too, must have planets rotating around it, and that
these planets must have an oxygen atmosphere and clouds of aqueous
vapor like our own. We have interpreted the double and multiple stars,
and, by an extension of the same law, explained their frequently
contrasted or complementary colors. The new stars which blaze up in
sudden conflagration and then die out have no secrets when this new
light is turned upon them; they, too, are but the faithful followers of
the law; and the temporary and variable stars likewise fall into their
appropriate categories and obediently move on with the procession. The
comets,&mdash;the banner-bearers of the sidereal hosts,&mdash;which
from the earliest ages have defied science to read their cabalistic
legend, find it now &ldquo;writ large&rdquo; and in plain English. Even
the meteorites, the cosmical dust, the unorganized <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
of space, are found to be amenable to the same law. When we turn in
wider gaze to spy out the fantastic nebul&aelig; on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>very
outer fringe of visible things, after we have separated out the
star-clusters and organized galaxies of suns, we apply our touchstone
to the irresolvable gaseous nebul&aelig;, and lo! their mystery
dissolves at a touch. We have even been able to picture the processes
of the creation of solar systems and whole galaxies of suns in which
the same law finds scope, and by its infinite and harmonious extension
we learn that nature moves with a comprehensive plan, and is uniform in
her infinite variety and eternal in her ceaseless activity. We have
been told that&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The poem of the universe</p>
<p class="line xd26e3205">No rhythm has nor rhyme;</p>
<p class="line">Some god recites the wondrous song,</p>
<p class="line xd26e3205">A stanza at a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">But it is all a mistake; the loftiest strains which
ever inspired the soul of Mozart or of Beethoven had not the ineffable
harmony, nor the sweetest songs of the greatest poets the perfect
rhyme, ever repeated and ever varied, of the universe. Its orderly
progress is like the onward movement of a mighty army, and there is but
one grand commander, &ldquo;but one God,&rdquo; and Nature, that
showeth forth his handiwork, &ldquo;is his prophet.&rdquo; We have
found that the &ldquo;course of nature,&rdquo; the eternally youthful
mother, is the same, whether in spinning a tendril in the garden, in
weaving a whirlwind in the atmosphere, or in elaborating from the
universal vapors of primordial space a solar system or a galaxy. And it
is not a convulsive, spasmodic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348"
href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span>nature that we find; we do
not love to associate great explosions, cataclysms, the destruction of
worlds, or the extinction of suns with our ideas of nature. These seem
not to be of nature. The nature we love is the gentle mother, uniform
in her operations, kindly in her ways, beneficent in her results; the
nature of the rain, the sunshine, seed-time and harvest and the
sprouting seed again; ever patient, ever responsive, but in all as firm
and steadfast as the foundations of eternity itself. So we have found
her. We have assumed nothing; we have observed and endeavored to deduce
from observation her systematic plan, for this is the voice of her law,
&ldquo;the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.&rdquo; To quote the
words of Matthew Arnold, from out the darkness of the past we seem to
hear her say,&mdash;</p>
